<h2>The Moral Principle and the Material Interest . . .</h2>
<p>A Moral Principle met a Material Interest on a bridge wide 
enough for but one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down, you base thing!&rdquo; thundered the Moral 
Principle, &ldquo;and let me pass over you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Material Interest merely looked in the other&rsquo;s eyes 
without saying anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the Moral Principle, hesitatingly, 
&ldquo;let us draw lots to see which shall retire till the other 
has crossed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Material Interest maintained an unbroken silence and an 
unwavering stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In order to avoid a conflict,&rdquo; the Moral 
Principle resumed, somewhat uneasily, &ldquo;I shall myself lie 
down and let you walk over me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Material Interest found a tongue, and by a strange 
coincidence it was its own tongue.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t 
think you are very good walking,&rdquo; it said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I 
am a little particular about what I have underfoot.&nbsp; Suppose
you get off into the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It occurred that way.</p>
<h2>The Crimson Candle</h2>
<p>A man lying at the point of death called his wife to his 
bedside and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am about to leave you forever; give me, therefore, 
one last proof of your affection and fidelity, for, according to 
our holy religion, a married man seeking admittance at the gate 
of Heaven is required to swear that he has never defiled himself 
with an unworthy woman.&nbsp; In my desk you will find a crimson 
candle, which has been blessed by the High Priest and has a 
peculiar mystical significance.&nbsp; Swear to me that while it 
is in existence you will not remarry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Woman swore and the Man died.&nbsp; At the funeral the 
Woman stood at the head of the bier, holding a lighted crimson 
candle till it was wasted entirely away.</p>
<h2>The Blotted Escutcheon and the Soiled Ermine</h2>
<p>A Blotted Escutcheon, rising to a question of privilege, 
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Speaker, I wish to hurl back an allegation and 
explain that the spots upon me are the natural markings of one 
who is a direct descendant of the sun and a spotted fawn.&nbsp; 
They come of no accident of character, but inhere in the divine 
order and constitution of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Blotted Escutcheon had resumed his seat a Soiled 
Ermine rose and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Speaker, I have heard with profound attention and 
entire approval the explanation of the honourable member, and 
wish to offer a few remarks on my own behalf.&nbsp; I, too, have 
been foully calumniated by our ancient enemy, the Infamous 
Falsehood, and I wish to point out that I am made of the fur of 
the <i>Mustela maculata</i>, which is dirty from 
birth.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Ingenious Patriot</h2>
<p>Having obtained an audience of the King an Ingenious Patriot 
pulled a paper from his pocket, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;May it please your Majesty, I have here a formula for 
constructing armour-plating which no gun can pierce.&nbsp; If 
these plates are adopted in the Royal Navy our warships will be 
invulnerable, and therefore invincible.&nbsp; Here, also, are 
reports of your Majesty&rsquo;s Ministers, attesting the value of
the invention.&nbsp; I will part with my right in it for a 
million tumtums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After examining the papers, the King put them away and 
promised him an order on the Lord High Treasurer of the Extortion
Department for a million tumtums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here,&rdquo; said the Ingenious Patriot, pulling 
another paper from another pocket, &ldquo;are the working plans 
of a gun that I have invented, which will pierce that 
armour.&nbsp; Your Majesty&rsquo;s Royal Brother, the Emperor of 
Bang, is anxious to purchase it, but loyalty to your 
Majesty&rsquo;s throne and person constrains me to offer it first
to your Majesty.&nbsp; The price is one million 
tumtums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having received the promise of another check, he thrust his 
hand into still another pocket, remarking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The price of the irresistible gun would have been much 
greater, your Majesty, but for the fact that its missiles can be 
so effectively averted by my peculiar method of treating the 
armour plates with a new&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King signed to the Great Head Factotum to approach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Search this man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and report how 
many pockets he has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty-three, Sire,&rdquo; said the Great Head Factotum,
completing the scrutiny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May it please your Majesty,&rdquo; cried the Ingenious 
Patriot, in terror, &ldquo;one of them contains 
tobacco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold him up by the ankles and shake him,&rdquo; said 
the King; &ldquo;then give him a check for forty-two million 
tumtums and put him to death.&nbsp; Let a decree issue declaring 
ingenuity a capital offence.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Two Kings</h2>
<p>The King of Madagao, being engaged in a dispute with the King 
of Bornegascar, wrote him as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before proceeding further in this matter I demand the 
recall of your Minister from my capital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greatly enraged by this impossible demand, the King of 
Bornegascar replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not recall my Minister.&nbsp; Moreover, if you 
do not immediately retract your demand I shall withdraw 
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This threat so terrified the King of Madagao that in hastening
to comply he fell over his own feet, breaking the Third 
Commandment.</p>
<h2>An Officer and a Thug</h2>
<p>A Chief of Police who had seen an Officer beating a Thug was 
very indignant, and said he must not do so any more on pain of 
dismissal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too hard on me,&rdquo; said the Officer,
smiling; &ldquo;I was beating him with a stuffed club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; persisted the Chief of Police, 
&ldquo;it was a liberty that must have been very disagreeable, 
though it may not have hurt.&nbsp; Please do not repeat 
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the Officer, still smiling, &ldquo;it 
was a stuffed Thug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In attempting to express his gratification, the Chief of 
Police thrust out his right hand with such violence that his skin
was ruptured at the arm-pit and a stream of sawdust poured from 
the wound.&nbsp; He was a stuffed Chief of Police.</p>
<h2>The Conscientious Official</h2>
<p>While a Division Superintendent of a railway was attending 
closely to his business of placing obstructions on the track and 
tampering with the switches he received word that the President 
of the road was about to discharge him for incompetency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;there are more 
accidents on my division than on all the rest of the 
line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The President is very particular,&rdquo; said the Man 
who brought him the news; &ldquo;he thinks the same loss of life 
might be effected with less damage to the company&rsquo;s 
property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he expect me to shoot passengers through the car 
windows?&rdquo; exclaimed the indignant official, spiking a loose
tie across the rails.&nbsp; &ldquo;Does he take me for an 
assassin?&rdquo;</p>
<h2>How Leisure Came</h2>
<p>A Man to Whom Time Was Money, and who was bolting his 
breakfast in order to catch a train, had leaned his newspaper 
against the sugar-bowl and was reading as he ate.&nbsp; In his 
haste and abstraction he stuck a pickle-fork into his right eye, 
and on removing the fork the eye came with it.&nbsp; In buying 
spectacles the needless outlay for the right lens soon reduced 
him to poverty, and the Man to Whom Time Was Money had to sustain
life by fishing from the end of a wharf.</p>
<h2>The Moral Sentiment</h2>
<p>A Pugilist met the Moral Sentiment of the Community, who was 
carrying a hat-box.&nbsp; &ldquo;What have you in the hat-box, my
friend?&rdquo; inquired the Pugilist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A new frown,&rdquo; was the answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am 
bringing it from the frownery&mdash;the one over there with the 
gilded steeple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are you going to do with the nice new 
frown?&rdquo; the Pugilist asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put down pugilism&mdash;if I have to wear it night and 
day,&rdquo; said the Moral Sentiment of the Community, 
sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&lsquo;s right,&rdquo; said the Pugilist, 
&ldquo;that is right, my good friend; if pugilism had been put 
down yesterday, I wouldn&rsquo;t have this kind of Nose 
to-day.&nbsp; I had a rattling hot fight last evening 
with&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; cried the Moral Sentiment of the 
Community, with sudden animation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Which 
licked?&nbsp; Sit down here on the hat-box and tell me all about 
it!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Politicians</h2>
<p>An Old Politician and a Young Politician were travelling 
through a beautiful country, by the dusty highway which leads to 
the City of Prosperous Obscurity.&nbsp; Lured by the flowers and 
the shade and charmed by the songs of birds which invited to 
woodland paths and green fields, his imagination fired by 
glimpses of golden domes and glittering palaces in the distance 
on either hand, the Young Politician said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us, I beseech thee, turn aside from this 
comfortless road leading, thou knowest whither, but not I.&nbsp; 
Let us turn our backs upon duty and abandon ourselves to the 
delights and advantages which beckon from every grove and call to
us from every shining hill.&nbsp; Let us, if so thou wilt, follow
this beautiful path, which, as thou seest, hath a guide-board 
saying, &lsquo;Turn in here all ye who seek the Palace of 
Political Distinction.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a beautiful path, my son,&rdquo; said the Old 
Politician, without either slackening his pace or turning his 
head, &ldquo;and it leadeth among pleasant scenes.&nbsp; But the 
search for the Palace of Political Distinction is beset with one 
mighty peril.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; said the Young Politician.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The peril of finding it,&rdquo; the Old Politician 
replied, pushing on.</p>
<h2>The Thoughtful Warden</h2>
<p>The Warden of a Penitentiary was one day putting locks on the 
doors of all the cells when a mechanic said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those locks can all be opened from the inside&mdash;you
are very imprudent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Warden did not look up from his work, but said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that is called imprudence, I wonder what would be 
called a thoughtful provision against the vicissitudes of 
fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Treasury and the Arms</h2>
<p>A Public Treasury, feeling Two Arms lifting out its contents, 
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Shareman, I move for a division.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to know something about parliamentary forms of
speech,&rdquo; said the Two Arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the Public Treasury, &ldquo;I am 
familiar with the hauls of legislation.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Christian Serpent</h2>
<p>A Rattlesnake came home to his brood and said: &ldquo;My 
children, gather about and receive your father&rsquo;s last 
blessing, and see how a Christian dies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ails you, Father?&rdquo; asked the Small 
Snakes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been bitten by the editor of a partisan 
journal,&rdquo; was the reply, accompanied by the ominous 
death-rattle.</p>
<h2>The Broom of the Temple</h2>
<p>The city of Gakwak being about to lose its character of 
capital of the province of Ukwuk, the Wampog issued a 
proclamation convening all the male residents in council in the 
Temple of Ul to devise means of defence.&nbsp; The first speaker 
thought the best policy would be to offer a fried jackass to the 
gods.&nbsp; The second suggested a public procession, headed by 
the Wampog himself, bearing the Holy Poker on a cushion of 
cloth-of-brass.&nbsp; Another thought that a scarlet mole should 
be buried alive in the public park and a suitable incantation 
chanted over the remains.&nbsp; The advice of the fourth was that
the columns of the capitol be rubbed with oil of dog by a person 
having a moustache on the calf of his leg.&nbsp; When all the 
others had spoken an Aged Man rose and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;High and mighty Wampog and fellow-citizens, I have 
listened attentively to all the plans proposed.&nbsp; All seem 
wise, and I do not suffer myself to doubt that any one of them 
would be efficacious.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I cannot help thinking 
that if we would put an improved breed of polliwogs in our 
drinking water, construct shallower roadways, groom the street 
cows, offer the stranger within our gates a free choice between 
the poniard and the potion, and relinquish our private system of 
morals, the other measures of public safety would be 
needless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Aged Man was about to speak further, but the meeting 
informally adjourned in order to sweep the floor of the 
temple&mdash;for the men of Gakwak are the tidiest housewives in 
all that province.&nbsp; The last speaker was the broom.</p>
<h2>The Critics</h2>
<p>While bathing, Antinous was seen by Minerva, who was so 
enamoured of his beauty that, all armed as she happened to be, 
she descended from Olympus to woo him; but, unluckily displaying 
her shield, with the head of Medusa on it, she had the 
unhappiness to see the beautiful mortal turn to stone from 
catching a glimpse of it.&nbsp; She straightway ascended to ask 
Jove to restore him; but before this could be done a Sculptor and
a Critic passed that way and espied him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a very bad Apollo,&rdquo; said the Sculptor: 
&ldquo;the chest is too narrow, and one arm is at least a 
half-inch shorter than the other.&nbsp; The attitude is 
unnatural, and I may say impossible.&nbsp; Ah! my friend, you 
should see my statue of Antinous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my judgment, the figure,&rdquo; said the Critic, 
&ldquo;is tolerably good, though rather Etrurian, but the 
expression of the face is decidedly Tuscan, and therefore false 
to nature.&nbsp; By the way, have you read my work on &lsquo;The 
Fallaciousness of the Aspectual in Art&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Foolish Woman</h2>
<p>A Married Woman, whose lover was about to reform by running 
away, procured a pistol and shot him dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you do that, Madam?&rdquo; inquired a 
Policeman, sauntering by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied the Married Woman, &ldquo;he 
was a wicked man, and had purchased a ticket to 
Chicago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sister,&rdquo; said an adjacent Man of God, 
solemnly, &ldquo;you cannot stop the wicked from going to Chicago
by killing them.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Father and Son</h2>
<p>&ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; said an aged Father to his fiery and 
disobedient Son, &ldquo;a hot temper is the soil of 
remorse.&nbsp; Promise me that when next you are angry you will 
count one hundred before you move or speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner had the Son promised than he received a stinging 
blow from the paternal walking-stick, and by the time he had 
counted to seventy-five had the unhappiness to see the old man 
jump into a waiting cab and whirl away.</p>
<h2>The Discontented Malefactor</h2>
<p>A Judge having sentenced a Malefactor to the penitentiary was 
proceeding to point out to him the disadvantages of crime and the
profit of reformation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Honour,&rdquo; said the Malefactor, interrupting, 
&ldquo;would you be kind enough to alter my punishment to ten 
years in the penitentiary and nothing else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the Judge, surprised, &ldquo;I have 
given you only three years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; assented the 
Malefactor&mdash;&ldquo;three years&rsquo; imprisonment and the 
preaching.&nbsp; If you please, I should like to commute the 
preaching.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>A Call to Quit</h2>
<p>Seeing that his audiences were becoming smaller every Sunday, 
a Minister of the Gospel broke off in the midst of a sermon, 
descended the pulpit stairs, and walked on his hands down the 
central aisle of the church.&nbsp; He then remounted his feet, 
ascended to the pulpit, and resumed his discourse, making no 
allusion to the incident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he to himself, as he went home, 
&ldquo;I shall have, henceforth, a large attendance and no 
snoring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But on the following Friday he was waited upon by the Pillars 
of the Church, who informed him that in order to be in harmony 
with the New Theology and get full advantage of modern methods of
Gospel interpretation they had deemed it advisable to make a 
change.&nbsp; They had therefore sent a call to Brother 
Jowjeetum-Fallal, the World-Renowned Hindoo Human Pin-Wheel, then
holding forth in Hoopitup&rsquo;s circus.&nbsp; They were happy 
to say that the reverend gentleman had been moved by the Spirit 
to accept the call, and on the ensuing Sabbath would break the 
bread of life for the brethren or break his neck in the 
attempt.</p>
<h2>The Man and the Lightning</h2>
<p>A Man Running for Office was overtaken by Lightning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said the Lightning, as it crept past 
him inch by inch, &ldquo;I can travel considerably faster than 
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the Man Running for Office replied, 
&ldquo;but think how much longer I keep going!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Lassoed Bear</h2>
<p>A Hunter who had lassoed a Bear was trying to disengage 
himself from the rope, but the slip-knot about his wrist would 
not yield, for the Bear was all the time pulling in the slack 
with his paws.&nbsp; In the midst of his trouble the Hunter saw a
Showman passing by, and managed to attract his attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you give me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for my 
Bear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be some five or ten minutes,&rdquo; said the 
Showman, &ldquo;before I shall want a fresh Bear, and it looks to
me as if prices would fall during that time.&nbsp; I think 
I&rsquo;ll wait and watch the market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The price of this animal,&rdquo; the Hunter replied, 
&ldquo;is down to bed-rock; you can have him for nothing a pound,
spot cash, and I&rsquo;ll throw in the next one that I 
lasso.&nbsp; But the purchaser must remove the goods from the 
premises forthwith, to make room for three man-eating tigers, a 
cat-headed gorilla, and an armful of rattlesnakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Showman passed on, in maiden meditation, fancy free, 
and being joined soon afterward by the Bear, who was absently 
picking his teeth, it was inferred that they were not 
unacquainted.</p>
<h2>The Ineffective Rooter</h2>
<p>A Drunken Man was lying in the road with a bleeding nose, upon
which he had fallen, when a Pig passed that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wallow fairly well,&rdquo; said the Pig, 
&ldquo;but, my fine fellow, you have much to learn about 
rooting.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>A Protagonist of Silver</h2>
<p>Some Financiers who were whetting their tongues on their teeth
because the Government had &ldquo;struck down&rdquo; silver, and 
were about to &ldquo;inaugurate&rdquo; a season of sweatshed, 
were addressed as follows by a Member of their honourable and 
warlike body:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comrades of the thunder and companions of death, I 
cannot but regard it as singularly fortunate that we who by 
conviction and sympathy are designated by nature as the champions
of that fairest of her products, the white metal, should also, by
a happy chance, be engaged mostly in the business of mining 
it.&nbsp; Nothing could be more appropriate than that those who 
from unselfish motives and elevated sentiments are doing battle 
for the people&rsquo;s rights and interests, should themselves be
the chief beneficiaries of success.&nbsp; Therefore, O children 
of the earthquake and the storm, let us stand shoulder to 
shoulder, heart to heart, and pocket to pocket!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This speech so pleased the other Members of the convention 
that, actuated by a magnanimous impulse, they sprang to their 
feet and left the hall.&nbsp; It was the first time they had ever
been known to leave anything having value.</p>
<h2>The Holy Deacon</h2>
<p>An Itinerant Preacher who had wrought hard in the moral 
vineyard for several hours whispered to a Holy Deacon of the 
local church:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother, these people know you, and your active support
will bear fruit abundantly.&nbsp; Please pass the plate for me, 
and you shall have one fourth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Holy Deacon did so, and putting the money into his pocket 
waited till the congregation was dismissed and said 
goodnight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the money, brother, the money that you 
collected!&rdquo; said the Itinerant Preacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing is coming to you,&rdquo; was the reply; 
&ldquo;the Adversary has hardened their hearts, and one fourth is
all they gave.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>A Hasty Settlement</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Your Honour,&rdquo; said an Attorney, rising, 
&ldquo;what is the present status of this case&mdash;as far as it
has gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have given a judgment for the residuary legatee under
the will,&rdquo; said the Court, &ldquo;put the costs upon the 
contestants, decided all questions relating to fees and other 
charges; and, in short, the estate in litigation has been 
settled, with all controversies, disputes, misunderstandings, and
differences of opinion thereunto appertaining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, I see,&rdquo; said the Attorney, thoughtfully,
&ldquo;we are making progress&mdash;we are getting on 
famously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Progress?&rdquo; echoed the 
Judge&mdash;&ldquo;progress?&nbsp; Why, sir, the matter is 
concluded!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, exactly; it had to be concluded in order to 
give relevancy to the motion that I am about to make.&nbsp; Your 
Honour, I move that the judgment of the Court be set aside and 
the case reopened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon what ground, sir?&rdquo; the Judge asked in 
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon the ground,&rdquo; said the Attorney, &ldquo;that 
after paying all fees and expenses of litigation and all charges 
against the estate there will still be something left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may have been an error,&rdquo; said His Honour, 
thoughtfully&mdash;&ldquo;the Court may have underestimated the 
value of the estate.&nbsp; The motion is taken under 
advisement.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Wooden Guns</h2>
<p>An Artillery Regiment of a State Militia applied to the 
Governor for wooden guns to practise with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those,&rdquo; they explained, &ldquo;will be cheaper 
than real ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall not be said that I sacrificed efficiency to 
economy,&rdquo; said the Governor.&nbsp; &ldquo;You shall have 
real guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, thank you,&rdquo; cried the warriors, 
effusively.&nbsp; &ldquo;We will take good care of them, and in 
the event of war return them to the arsenal.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Reform School Board</h2>
<p>The members of the School Board in Doosnoswair being suspected
of appointing female teachers for an improper consideration, the 
people elected a Board composed wholly of women.&nbsp; In a few 
years the scandal was at an end; there were no female teachers in
the Department.</p>
<h2>The Poet&rsquo;s Doom</h2>
<p>An Object was walking along the King&rsquo;s highway wrapped 
in meditation and with little else on, when he suddenly found 
himself at the gates of a strange city.&nbsp; On applying for 
admittance, he was arrested as a necessitator of ordinances, and 
taken before the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;and what is 
your business in life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snouter the Sneak,&rdquo; replied the Object, with 
ready invention; &ldquo;pick-pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King was about to command him to be released when the 
Prime Minister suggested that the prisoner&rsquo;s fingers be 
examined.&nbsp; They were found greatly flattened and calloused 
at the ends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; cried the King; &ldquo;I told you 
so!&mdash;he is addicted to counting syllables.&nbsp; This is a 
poet.&nbsp; Turn him over to the Lord High Dissuader from the 
Head Habit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My liege,&rdquo; said the Inventor-in-Ordinary of 
Ingenious Penalties, &ldquo;I venture to suggest a keener 
affliction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name it,&rdquo; the King said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him retain that head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was so ordered.</p>
<h2>The Noser and the Note</h2>
<p>The Head Rifler of an insolvent bank, learning that it was 
about to be visited by the official Noser into Things, placed his
own personal note for a large amount among its resources, and, 
gaily touching his guitar, awaited the inspection.&nbsp; When the
Noser came to the note he asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s 
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said the Assistant Pocketer of Deposits, 
&ldquo;is one of our liabilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A liability?&rdquo; exclaimed the Noser.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Nay, nay, an asset.&nbsp; That is what you mean, 
doubtless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therein you err,&rdquo; the Pocketer explained; 
&ldquo;that note was written in the bank with our own pen, ink, 
and paper, and we have not paid a stationery bill for six 
months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I see,&rdquo; the Noser said, thoughtfully; 
&ldquo;it is a liability.&nbsp; May I ask how you expect to meet 
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With fortitude, please God,&rdquo; answered the 
Assistant Pocketer, his eyes to Heaven raising&mdash;&ldquo;with 
fortitude and a firm reliance on the laxity of the 
law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough, enough,&rdquo; exclaimed the faithful servant 
of the State, choking with emotion; &ldquo;here is a certificate 
of solvency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here is a bottle of ink,&rdquo; the grateful 
financier said, slipping it into the other&rsquo;s pocket; 
&ldquo;it is all that we have.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Cat and the King</h2>
<p>A Cat was looking at a King, as permitted by the proverb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the monarch, observing her inspection
of the royal person, &ldquo;how do you like me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can imagine a King,&rdquo; said the Cat, &ldquo;whom 
I should like better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For example?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King of the Mice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sovereign was so pleased with the wit of the reply that he
gave her permission to scratch his Prime Minister&rsquo;s eyes 
out.</p>
<h2>The Literary Astronomer</h2>
<p>The Director of an Observatory, who, with a thirty-six-inch 
refractor, had discovered the moon, hastened to an Editor, with a
four-column account of the event.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; said the Editor, sententiously, 
without looking up from his essay on the circularity of the 
political horizon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One hundred and sixty dollars,&rdquo; replied the man 
who had discovered the moon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not half enough,&rdquo; was the Editor&rsquo;s 
comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Generous man!&rdquo; cried the Astronomer, glowing with
warm and elevated sentiments, &ldquo;pay me, then, what you 
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great and good friend,&rdquo; said the Editor, blandly,
looking up from his work, &ldquo;we are far asunder, it 
seems.&nbsp; The paying is to be done by you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Director of the Observatory gathered up the manuscript and
went away, explaining that it needed correction; he had neglected
to dot an m.</p>
<h2>The Lion and the Rattlesnake</h2>
<p>A Man having found a Lion in his path undertook to subdue him 
by the power of the human eye; and near by was a Rattlesnake 
engaged in fascinating a small bird.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you getting on, brother?&rdquo; the Man called 
out to the other reptile, without removing his eyes from those of
the Lion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Admirably,&rdquo; replied the serpent.&nbsp; &ldquo;My 
success is assured; my victim draws nearer and nearer in spite of
her efforts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mine,&rdquo; said the Man, &ldquo;draws nearer and 
nearer in spite of mine.&nbsp; Are you sure it is all 
right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; the reptile replied
as well as he then could, with his mouth full of bird, &ldquo;you
better give it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half-hour later, the Lion, thoughtfully picking his teeth 
with his claws, told the Rattlesnake that he had never in all his
varied experience in being subdued, seen a subduer try so 
earnestly to give it up.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, with 
a wide, significant smile, &ldquo;I looked him into 
countenance.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Man with No Enemies</h2>
<p>An Inoffensive Person walking in a public place was assaulted 
by a Stranger with a Club, and severely beaten.</p>
<p>When the Stranger with a Club was brought to trial, the 
complainant said to the Judge:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know why I was assaulted; I have not an enemy 
in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said the defendant, &ldquo;is why I struck
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the prisoner be discharged,&rdquo; said the Judge; 
&ldquo;a man who has no enemies has no friends.&nbsp; The courts 
are not for such.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Alderman and the Raccoon</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I see quite a number of rings on your tail,&rdquo; said
an Alderman to a Raccoon that he met in a zo&ouml;logical 
garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the Raccoon, &ldquo;and I hear 
quite a number of tales on your ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Alderman, being of a sensitive, retiring disposition, 
shrank from further comparison, and, strolling to another part of
the garden, stole the camel.</p>
<h2>The Flying-Machine</h2>
<p>An Ingenious Man who had built a flying-machine invited a 
great concourse of people to see it go up.&nbsp; At the appointed
moment, everything being ready, he boarded the car and turned on 
the power.&nbsp; The machine immediately broke through the 
massive substructure upon which it was builded, and sank out of 
sight into the earth, the aeronaut springing out barely in time 
to save himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have done enough to 
demonstrate the correctness of my details.&nbsp; The 
defects,&rdquo; he added, with a look at the ruined brick-work, 
&ldquo;are merely basic and fundamental.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon this assurance the people came forward with subscriptions
to build a second machine.</p>
<h2>The Angel&rsquo;s Tear</h2>
<p>An Unworthy Man who had laughed at the woes of a Woman whom he
loved, was bewailing his indiscretion in sack-cloth-of-gold and 
ashes-of-roses, when the Angel of Compassion looked down upon 
him, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor mortal!&mdash;how unblest not to know the 
wickedness of laughing at another&rsquo;s misfortune!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, he let fall a great tear, which, encountering in 
its descent a current of cold air, was congealed into a 
hail-stone.&nbsp; This struck the Unworthy Man on the head and 
set him rubbing that bruised organ vigorously with one hand while
vainly attempting to expand an umbrella with the other.</p>
<p>Thereat the Angel of Compassion did most shamelessly and 
wickedly laugh.</p>
<h2>The City of Political Distinction</h2>
<p>Jamrach the Rich, being anxious to reach the City of Political
Distinction before nightfall, arrived at a fork of the road and 
was undecided which branch to follow; so he consulted a 
Wise-Looking Person who sat by the wayside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take <i>that</i> road,&rdquo; said the Wise-Looking 
Person, pointing it out; &ldquo;it is known as the Political 
Highway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Jamrach, and was about to 
proceed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About how much do you thank me?&rdquo; was the 
reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you suppose I am here for my 
health?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Jamrach had not become rich by stupidity, he handed 
something to his guide and hastened on, and soon came to a 
toll-gate kept by a Benevolent Gentleman, to whom he gave 
something, and was suffered to pass.&nbsp; A little farther along
he came to a bridge across an imaginary stream, where a Civil 
Engineer (who had built the bridge) demanded something for 
interest on his investment, and it was forthcoming.&nbsp; It was 
growing late when Jamrach came to the margin of what appeared to 
be a lake of black ink, and there the road terminated.&nbsp; 
Seeing a Ferryman in his boat he paid something for his passage 
and was about to embark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Ferryman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Put your 
neck in this noose, and I will tow you over.&nbsp; It is the only
way,&rdquo; he added, seeing that the passenger was about to 
complain of the accommodations.</p>
<p>In due time he was dragged across, half strangled, and 
dreadfully beslubbered by the feculent waters.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said the Ferryman, hauling him ashore and 
disengaging him, &ldquo;you are now in the City of Political 
Distinction.&nbsp; It has fifty millions of inhabitants, and as 
the colour of the Filthy Pool does not wash off, they all look 
exactly alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; exclaimed Jamrach, weeping and bewailing 
the loss of all his possessions, paid out in tips and tolls; 
&ldquo;I will go back with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you will,&rdquo;, said the 
Ferryman, pushing off; &ldquo;this city is situated on the Island
of the Unreturning.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Party Over There</h2>
<p>A Man in a Hurry, whose watch was at his lawyer&rsquo;s, asked
a Grave Person the time of day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard you ask that Party Over There the same 
question,&rdquo; said the Grave Person.&nbsp; &ldquo;What answer 
did he give you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said it was about three o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; 
replied the Man in a Hurry; &ldquo;but he did not look at his 
watch, and as the sun is nearly down, I think it is 
later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact that the sun is nearly down,&rdquo; the Grave 
Person said, &ldquo;is immaterial, but the fact that he did not 
consult his timepiece and make answer after due deliberation and 
consideration is fatal.&nbsp; The answer given,&rdquo; continued 
the Grave Person, consulting his own timepiece, &ldquo;is of no 
effect, invalid, and absurd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, then,&rdquo; said the Man in a Hurry, eagerly, 
&ldquo;is the time of day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The question is remanded to the Party Over There for a 
new answer,&rdquo; replied the Grave Person, returning his watch 
to his pocket and moving away with great dignity.</p>
<p>He was a Judge of an Appellate Court.</p>
<h2>The Poetess of Reform</h2>
<p>One pleasant day in the latter part of eternity, as the Shades
of all the great writers were reposing upon beds of asphodel and 
moly in the Elysian fields, each happy in hearing from the lips 
of the others nothing but copious quotation from his own works 
(for so Jove had kindly bedeviled their ears), there came in 
among them with triumphant mien a Shade whom none knew.&nbsp; She
(for the newcomer showed such evidences of sex as cropped hair 
and a manly stride) took a seat in their midst, and smiling a 
superior smile explained:</p>
<p>&ldquo;After centuries of oppression I have wrested my rights 
from the grasp of the jealous gods.&nbsp; On earth I was the 
Poetess of Reform, and sang to inattentive ears.&nbsp; Now for an
eternity of honour and glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was not to be so, and soon she was the unhappiest of 
mortals, vainly desirous to wander again in gloom by the infernal
lakes.&nbsp; For Jove had not bedeviled her ears, and she heard 
from the lips of each blessed Shade an incessant flow of 
quotation from his own works.&nbsp; Moreover, she was denied the 
happiness of repeating her poems.&nbsp; She could not recall a 
line of them, for Jove had decreed that the memory of them abide 
in Pluto&rsquo;s painful domain, as a part of the apparatus.</p>
<h2>The Unchanged Diplomatist</h2>
<p>The republic of Madagonia had been long and well represented 
at the court of the King of Patagascar by an officer called a 
Dazie, but one day the Madagonian Parliament conferred upon him 
the superior rank of Dandee.&nbsp; The next day after being 
apprised of his new dignity he hastened to inform the King of 
Patagascar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, I understand,&rdquo; said the King; &ldquo;you
have been promoted and given increased pay and allowances.&nbsp; 
There was an appropriation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have now two heads, have you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, your Majesty&mdash;only one, I assure 
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&nbsp; And how many legs and arms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two of each, Sire&mdash;only two of each.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And only one body?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a single body, as you perceive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thoughtfully removing his crown and scratching the royal head,
the monarch was silent a moment, and then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy that appropriation has been misapplied.&nbsp; 
You seem to be about the same kind of idiot that you were 
before.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>An Invitation</h2>
<p>A Pious Person who had overcharged his paunch with dead bird 
by way of attesting his gratitude for escaping the many 
calamities which Heaven had sent upon others, fell asleep at 
table and dreamed.&nbsp; He thought he lived in a country where 
turkeys were the ruling class, and every year they held a feast 
to manifest their sense of Heaven&rsquo;s goodness in sparing 
their lives to kill them later.&nbsp; One day, about a week 
before one of these feasts, he met the Supreme Gobbler, who 
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will please get yourself into good condition for 
the Thanksgiving dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your Excellency,&rdquo; replied the Pious Person, 
delighted, &ldquo;I shall come hungry, I assure you.&nbsp; It is 
no small privilege to dine with your Excellency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Supreme Gobbler eyed him for a moment in silence; then he 
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As one of the lower domestic animals, you cannot be 
expected to know much, but you might know something.&nbsp; Since 
you do not, you will permit me to point out that being asked to 
dinner is one thing; being asked to dine is another and a 
different thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this significant remark the Supreme Gobbler left him, and
thenceforward the Pious Person dreamed of himself as white meat 
and dark until rudely awakened by decapitation.</p>
<h2>The Ashes of Madame Blavatsky</h2>
<p>The two brightest lights of Theosophy being in the same place 
at once in company with the Ashes of Madame Blavatsky, an 
Inquiring Soul thought the time propitious to learn something 
worth while.&nbsp; So he sat at the feet of one awhile, and then 
he sat awhile at the feet of the other, and at last he applied 
his ear to the keyhole of the casket containing the Ashes of 
Madame Blavatsky.&nbsp; When the Inquiring Soul had completed his
course of instruction he declared himself the Ahkoond of Swat, 
fell into the baleful habit of standing on his head, and swore 
that the mother who bore him was a pragmatic paralogism.&nbsp; 
Wherefore he was held in high reverence, and when the two other 
gentlemen were hanged for lying the Theosophists elected him to 
the leadership of their Disastral Body, and after a quiet life 
and an honourable death by the kick of a jackass he was 
reincarnated as a Yellow Dog.&nbsp; As such he ate the Ashes of 
Madame Blavatsky, and Theosophy was no more.</p>
<h2>The Opossum of the Future</h2>
<p>One day an Opossum who had gone to sleep hanging from the 
highest branch of a tree by the tail, awoke and saw a large Snake
wound about the limb, between him and the trunk of the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I hold on,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;I shall
be swallowed; if I let go I shall break my neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But suddenly he bethought himself to dissemble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My perfected friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my parental
instinct recognises in you a noble evidence and illustration of 
the theory of development.&nbsp; You are the Opossum of the 
Future, the ultimate Fittest Survivor of our species, the ripe 
result of progressive prehensility&mdash;all tail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Snake, proud of his ancient eminence in Scriptural 
history, was strictly orthodox, and did not accept the scientific
view.</p>
<h2>The Life-Savers</h2>
<p>Seventy-Five Men presented themselves before the President of 
the Humane Society and demanded the great gold medal for 
life-saving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said the President; &ldquo;by diligent
effort so many men must have saved a considerable number of 
lives.&nbsp; How many did you save?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventy-five, sir,&rdquo; replied their Spokesman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, that is one each&mdash;very good 
work&mdash;very good work, indeed,&rdquo; the President 
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You shall not only have the Society&rsquo;s 
great gold medal, but its recommendation for employment at the 
various life-boat stations along the coast.&nbsp; But how did you
save so many lives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Spokesman of the Men replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are officers of the law, and have just returned from
the pursuit of two murderous outlaws.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Australian Grasshopper</h2>
<p>A Distinguished Naturalist was travelling in Australia, when 
he saw a Kangaroo in session and flung a stone at it.&nbsp; The 
Kangaroo immediately adjourned, tracing against the sunset sky a 
parabolic curve spanning seven provinces, and evanished below the
horizon.&nbsp; The Distinguished Naturalist looked interested, 
but said nothing for an hour; then he said to his native 
Guide:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have pretty wide meadows here, I 
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not very wide,&rdquo; the Guide answered; 
&ldquo;about the same as in England and America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After another long silence the Distinguished Naturalist 
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hay which we shall purchase for our horses this 
evening&mdash;I shall expect to find the stalks about fifty feet 
long.&nbsp; Am I right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; said the Guide; &ldquo;a foot or two is
about the usual length of our hay.&nbsp; What can you be thinking
of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Distinguished Naturalist made no immediate reply, but 
later, as in the shades of night they journeyed through the 
desolate vastness of the Great Lone Land, he broke the 
silence:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of the uncommon 
magnitude of that grasshopper.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Pavior</h2>
<p>An Author saw a Labourer hammering stones into the pavement of
a street, and approaching him said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend, you seem weary.&nbsp; Ambition is a hard 
taskmaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m working for Mr. Jones, sir,&rdquo; the 
Labourer replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, cheer up,&rdquo; the Author resumed; &ldquo;fame 
comes at the most unexpected times.&nbsp; To-day you are poor, 
obscure, and disheartened, and to-morrow the world may be ringing
with your name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you giving me?&rdquo; the Labourer said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Cannot an honest pavior perform his work in peace, and get
his money for it, and his living by it, without others talking 
rot about ambition and hopes of fame?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cannot an honest writer?&rdquo; said the Author.</p>
<h2>The Tried Assassin</h2>
<p>An Assassin being put upon trial in a New England court, his 
Counsel rose and said: &ldquo;Your Honour, I move for a discharge
on the ground of &lsquo;once in jeopardy&rsquo;: my client has 
been already tried for that murder and acquitted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what court?&rdquo; asked the Judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Superior Court of San Francisco,&rdquo; the 
Counsel replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the trial proceed&mdash;your motion is 
denied,&rdquo; said the Judge.&nbsp; &ldquo;An Assassin is not in
jeopardy when tried in California.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Bumbo of Jiam</h2>
<p>The Pahdour of Patagascar and the Gookul of Madagonia were 
disputing about an island which both claimed.&nbsp; Finally, at 
the suggestion of the International League of Cannon Founders, 
which had important branches in both countries, they decided to 
refer their claims to the Bumbo of Jiam, and abide by his 
judgment.&nbsp; In settling the preliminaries of the arbitration 
they had, however, the misfortune to disagree, and appealed to 
arms.&nbsp; At the end of a long and disastrous war, when both 
sides were exhausted and bankrupt, the Bumbo of Jiam intervened 
in the interest of peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My great and good friends,&rdquo; he said to his 
brother sovereigns, &ldquo;it will be advantageous to you to 
learn that some questions are more complex and perilous than 
others, presenting a greater number of points upon which it is 
possible to differ.&nbsp; For four generations your royal 
predecessors disputed about possession of that island, without 
falling out.&nbsp; Beware, oh, beware the perils of international
arbitration!&mdash;against which I feel it my duty to protect you
henceforth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, he annexed both countries, and after a long, 
peaceful, and happy reign was poisoned by his Prime Minister.</p>
<h2>The Two Poets</h2>
<p>Two Poets were quarrelling for the Apple of Discord and the 
Bone of Contention, for they were very hungry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sons,&rdquo; said Apollo, &ldquo;I will part the 
prizes between you.&nbsp; You,&rdquo; he said to the First Poet, 
&ldquo;excel in Art&mdash;take the Apple.&nbsp; And you,&rdquo; 
he said to the Second Poet, &ldquo;in Imagination&mdash;take the 
Bone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Art the best prize!&rdquo; said the First Poet, 
triumphantly, and endeavouring to devour his award broke all his 
teeth.&nbsp; The Apple was a work of Art.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That shows our Master&rsquo;s contempt for mere 
Art,&rdquo; said the Second Poet, grinning.</p>
<p>Thereupon he attempted to gnaw his Bone, but his teeth passed 
through it without resistance.&nbsp; It was an imaginary 
Bone.</p>
<h2>The Thistles upon the Grave</h2>
<p>A Mind Reader made a wager that he would be buried alive and 
remain so for six months, then be dug up alive.&nbsp; In order to
secure the grave against secret disturbance, it was sown with 
thistles.&nbsp; At the end of three months, the Mind Reader lost 
his money.&nbsp; He had come up to eat the thistles.</p>
<h2>The Shadow of the Leader</h2>
<p>A Political Leader was walking out one sunny day, when he 
observed his Shadow leaving him and walking rapidly away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back here, you scoundrel,&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had been a scoundrel,&rdquo; answered the Shadow, 
increasing its speed, &ldquo;I should not have left 
you.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Sagacious Rat</h2>
<p>A Rat that was about to emerge from his hole caught a glimpse 
of a Cat waiting for him, and descending to the colony at the 
bottom of the hole invited a Friend to join him in a visit to a 
neighbouring corn-bin.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would have gone 
alone,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but could not deny myself the 
pleasure of such distinguished company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the Friend, &ldquo;I will go 
with you.&nbsp; Lead on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead?&rdquo; exclaimed the other.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;What!&nbsp; <i>I</i> precede so great and illustrious a 
rat as you? No, indeed&mdash;after you, sir, after 
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pleased with this great show of deference, the Friend went 
ahead, and, leaving the hole first, was caught by the Cat, who 
immediately trotted away with him.&nbsp; The other then went out 
unmolested.</p>
<h2>The Member and the Soap</h2>
<p>A Member of the Kansas Legislature meeting a Cake of Soap was 
passing it by without recognition, but the Cake of Soap insisted 
on stopping and shaking hands.&nbsp; Thinking it might possibly 
be in the enjoyment of the elective franchise, he gave it a 
cordial and earnest grasp.&nbsp; On letting it go he observed 
that a portion of it adhered to his fingers, and running to a 
brook in great alarm he proceeded to wash it off.&nbsp; In doing 
so he necessarily got some on the other hand, and when he had 
finished washing, both were so white that he went to bed and sent
for a physician.</p>
<h2>Alarm and Pride</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Good-Morning, my friend,&rdquo; said Alarm to Pride; 
&ldquo;how are you this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very tired,&rdquo; replied Pride, seating himself on a 
stone by the wayside and mopping his steaming brow.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;The politicians are wearing me out by pointing to their 
dirty records with <i>me</i>, when they could as well use a 
stick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alarm sighed sympathetically, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is pretty much the same way here.&nbsp; Instead of 
using an opera-glass they view the acts of their opponents with 
<i>me</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As these patient drudges were mingling their tears, they were 
notified that they must go on duty again, for one of the 
political parties had nominated a thief and was about to hold a 
gratification meeting.</p>
<h2>A Causeway</h2>
<p>A Rich Woman having returned from abroad disembarked at the 
foot of Knee-deep Street, and was about to walk to her hotel 
through the mud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said a Policeman, &ldquo;I cannot permit 
you to do that; you would soil your shoes and 
stockings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that is of no importance, really,&rdquo; replied 
the Rich Woman, with a cheerful smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, madam, it is needless; from the wharf to the 
hotel, as you observe, extends an unbroken line of prostrate 
newspaper men who crave the honour of having you walk upon 
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; she said, seating herself in a 
doorway and unlocking her satchel, &ldquo;I shall have to put on 
my rubber boots.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Two in Trouble</h2>
<p>Meeting a fat and patriotic Statesman on his way to Washington
to beseech the President for an office, an idle Tramp accosted 
him and begged twenty-five cents with which to buy a suit of 
clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Melancholy wreck,&rdquo; said the Statesman, 
&ldquo;what brought you to this state of degradation?&nbsp; 
Liquor, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am temperate to the verge of absurdity,&rdquo; 
replied the Tramp.&nbsp; &ldquo;My foible was patriotism; I was 
ruined by the baneful habit of trying to serve my country.&nbsp; 
What ruined you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indolence.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Witch&rsquo;s Steed</h2>
<p>A Broomstick which had long served a witch as a steed 
complained of the nature of its employment, which it thought 
degrading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the Witch, &ldquo;I will give 
you work in which you will be associated with intellect&mdash;you
will come in contact with brains.&nbsp; I shall present you to a 
housewife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said the Broomstick, &ldquo;do you 
consider the hands of a housewife intellectual?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I referred,&rdquo; said the Witch, &ldquo;to the head 
of her good man.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The All Dog</h2>
<p>A Lion seeing a Poodle fell into laughter at the ridiculous 
spectacle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who ever saw so small a beast?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very true,&rdquo; said the Poodle, with austere 
dignity, &ldquo;that I am small; but, sir, I beg to observe that 
I am all dog.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Farmer&rsquo;s Friend</h2>
<p>A Great Philanthropist who had thought of himself in 
connection with the Presidency and had introduced a bill into 
Congress requiring the Government to loan every voter all the 
money that he needed, on his personal security, was explaining to
a Sunday-school at a railway station how much he had done for the
country, when an angel looked down from Heaven and wept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For example,&rdquo; said the Great Philanthropist, 
watching the teardrops pattering in the dust, &ldquo;these early 
rains are of incalculable advantage to the farmer.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Physicians Two</h2>
<p>A Wicked Old Man finding himself ill sent for a Physician, who
prescribed for him and went away.&nbsp; Then the Wicked Old Man 
sent for another Physician, saying nothing of the first, and an 
entirely different treatment was ordered.&nbsp; This continued 
for some weeks, the physicians visiting him on alternate days and
treating him for two different disorders, with constantly 
enlarging doses of medicine and more and more rigorous 
nursing.&nbsp; But one day they accidently met at his bedside 
while he slept, and the truth coming out a violent quarrel 
ensued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good friends,&rdquo; said the patient, awakened by 
the noise of the dispute, and apprehending the cause of it, 
&ldquo;pray be more reasonable.&nbsp; If I could for weeks endure
you both, can you not for a little while endure each other?&nbsp;
I have been well for ten days, but have remained in bed in the 
hope of gaining by repose the strength that would justify me in 
taking your medicines.&nbsp; So far I have touched none of 
it.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Overlooked Factor</h2>
<p>A Man that owned a fine Dog, and by a careful selection of its
mate had bred a number of animals but a little lower than the 
angels, fell in love with his washerwoman, married her, and 
reared a family of dolts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; he exclaimed, contemplating the melancholy
result, &ldquo;had I but chosen a mate for myself with half the 
care that I did for my Dog I should now be a proud and happy 
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure of that,&rdquo; said the Dog, 
overhearing the lament.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a difference, 
certainly, between your whelps and mine, but I venture to flatter
myself that it is not due altogether to the mothers.&nbsp; You 
and I are not entirely alike ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>A Racial Parallel</h2>
<p>Some White Christians engaged in driving Chinese Heathens out 
of an American town found a newspaper published in Peking in the 
Chinese tongue, and compelled one of their victims to translate 
an editorial.&nbsp; It turned out to be an appeal to the people 
of the Province of Pang Ki to drive the foreign devils out of the
country and burn their dwellings and churches.&nbsp; At this 
evidence of Mongolian barbarity the White Christians were so 
greatly incensed that they carried out their original design.</p>
<h2>The Honest Cadi</h2>
<p>A Robber who had plundered a Merchant of one thousand pieces 
of gold was taken before the Cadi, who asked him if he had 
anything to say why he should not be decapitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Honour,&rdquo; said the Robber, &ldquo;I could do 
no otherwise than take the money, for Allah made me that 
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your defence is ingenious and sound,&rdquo; said the 
Cadi, &ldquo;and I must acquit you of criminality.&nbsp; 
Unfortunately, Allah has made me so that I must also take off 
your head&mdash;unless,&rdquo; he added, thoughtfully, &ldquo;you
offer me half of the gold; for He made me weak under 
temptation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Robber put five hundred pieces of gold into the 
Cadi&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the Cadi.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall now 
remove but one half your head.&nbsp; To show my trust in your 
discretion I shall leave intact the half you talk 
with.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Kangaroo and the Zebra</h2>
<p>A Kangaroo hopping awkwardly along with some bulky object 
concealed in her pouch met a Zebra, and desirous of keeping his 
attention upon himself, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your costume looks as if you might have come out of the
penitentiary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Appearances are deceitful,&rdquo; replied the Zebra, 
smiling in the consciousness of a more insupportable wit, 
&ldquo;or I should have to think that you had come out of the 
Legislature.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>A Matter of Method</h2>
<p>A Philosopher seeing a Fool beating his Donkey, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abstain, my son, abstain, I implore.&nbsp; Those who 
resort to violence shall suffer from violence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said the Fool, diligently belabouring the 
animal, &ldquo;is what I&rsquo;m trying to teach this 
beast&mdash;which has kicked me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; said the Philosopher to himself, as 
he walked away, &ldquo;the wisdom of fools is no deeper nor truer
than ours, but they really do seem to have a more impressive way 
of imparting it.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Man of Principle</h2>
<p>During a shower of rain the Keeper of a Zo&ouml;logical garden
observed a Man of Principle crouching beneath the belly of the 
ostrich, which had drawn itself up to its full height to 
sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear sir,&rdquo; said the Keeper, &ldquo;if you
fear to get wet, you&rsquo;d better creep into the pouch of 
yonder female kangaroo&mdash;the <i>Saltarix 
mackintosha</i>&mdash;for if that ostrich wakes he will kick you 
to death in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help that,&rdquo; the Man of Principle 
replied, with that lofty scorn of practical considerations 
distinguishing his species.&nbsp; &ldquo;He may kick me to death 
if he wish, but until he does he shall give me shelter from the 
storm.&nbsp; He has swallowed my umbrella.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Returned Californian</h2>
<p>A Man was hanged by the neck until he was dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whence do you come?&rdquo; Saint Peter asked when the 
Man presented himself at the gate of Heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From California,&rdquo; replied the applicant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enter, my son, enter; you bring joyous 
tidings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Man had vanished inside, Saint Peter took his 
memorandum-tablet and made the following entry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;February 16, 1893.&nbsp; California occupied by the 
Christians.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Compassionate Physician</h2>
<p>A Kind-Hearted Physician sitting at the bedside of a patient 
afflicted with an incurable and painful disease, heard a noise 
behind him, and turning saw a cat laughing at the feeble efforts 
of a wounded mouse to drag itself out of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cruel beast!&rdquo; cried he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why 
don&rsquo;t you kill it at once, like a lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rising, he kicked the cat out of the door, and picking up the 
mouse compassionately put it out of its misery by pulling off its
head.&nbsp; Recalled to the bedside by the moans of his patient, 
the Kind-hearted Physician administered a stimulant, a tonic, and
a nutrient, and went away.</p>
<h2>Two of the Damned</h2>
<p>Two Blighted Beings, haggard, lachrymose, and detested, met on
a blasted heath in the light of a struggling moon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you a merry Christmas,&rdquo; said the First 
Blighted Being, in a voice like that of a singing tomb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I you a happy New Year,&rdquo; responded the Second
Blighted Being, with the accent of a penitent accordeon.</p>
<p>They then fell upon each other&rsquo;s neck and wept scalding 
rills down each other&rsquo;s spine in token of their banishment 
to the Realm of Ineffable Bosh.&nbsp; For one of these accursed 
creatures was the First of January, and the other the 
Twenty-fifth of December.</p>
<h2>The Austere Governor</h2>
<p>A Governor visiting a State prison was implored by a Convict 
to pardon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you in for?&rdquo; asked the Governor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I held a high office,&rdquo; the Convict humbly 
replied, &ldquo;and sold subordinate appointments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I decline to interfere,&rdquo; said the Governor, 
with asperity; &ldquo;a man who abuses his office by making it 
serve a private end and purvey a personal advantage is unfit to 
be free.&nbsp; By the way, Mr. Warden,&rdquo; he added to that 
official, as the Convict slunk away, &ldquo;in appointing you to 
this position, I was given to understand that your friends could 
make the Shikane county delegation to the next State convention 
solid for&mdash;for the present Administration.&nbsp; Was I 
rightly informed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, I will bid you good-day.&nbsp; Please 
be so good as to appoint my nephew Night Chaplain and Reminder of
Mothers and Sisters.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Religions of Error</h2>
<p>Hearing a sound of strife, a Christian in the Orient asked his
Dragoman the cause of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Buddhists are cutting Mohammedan throats,&rdquo; 
the Dragoman replied, with oriental composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not know,&rdquo; remarked the Christian, with 
scientific interest, &ldquo;that that would make so much 
noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Mohammedans are cutting Buddhist throats, 
too,&rdquo; added the Dragoman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is astonishing,&rdquo; mused the Christian, 
&ldquo;how violent and how general are religious 
animosities.&nbsp; Everywhere in the world the devotees of each 
local faith abhor the devotees of every other, and abstain from 
murder only so long as they dare not commit it.&nbsp; And the 
strangest thing about it is that all religions are erroneous and 
mischievous excepting mine.&nbsp; Mine, thank God, is true and 
benign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying he visibly smugged and went off to telegraph for a 
brigade of cutthroats to protect Christian interests.</p>
<h2>The Penitent Elector</h2>
<p>A Person belonging to the Society for Passing Resolutions of 
Respect for the Memory of Deceased Members having died received 
the customary attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed a Sovereign Elector, on 
hearing the resolutions read, &ldquo;what a loss to the 
nation!&nbsp; And to think that I once voted against that angel 
for Inspector of Gate-latches in Public Squares!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In remorse the Sovereign Elector deprived himself of political
influence by learning to read.</p>
<h2>The Tail of the Sphinx</h2>
<p>A Dog of a taciturn disposition said to his Tail:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever I am angry, you rise and bristle; when I am 
pleased, you wag; when I am alarmed, you tuck yourself in out of 
danger.&nbsp; You are too mercurial&mdash;you disclose all my 
emotions.&nbsp; My notion is that tails are given to conceal 
thought.&nbsp; It is my dearest ambition to be as impassive as 
the Sphinx.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend, you must recognise the laws and limitations 
of your being,&rdquo; replied the Tail, with flexions appropriate
to the sentiments uttered, &ldquo;and try to be great some other 
way.&nbsp; The Sphinx has one hundred and fifty qualifications 
for impassiveness which you lack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they?&rdquo; the Dog asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One hundred and forty-nine tons of sand on her 
tail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stone tail.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>A Prophet of Evil</h2>
<p>An Undertaker Who Was a Member of a Trust saw a Man Leaning on
a Spade, and asked him why he was not at work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said the Man Leaning on a Spade, 
&ldquo;I belong to the Gravediggers&rsquo; National Extortion 
Society, and we have decided to limit the production of graves 
and get more money for the reduced output.&nbsp; We have a corner
in graves and propose to work it to the best 
advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said the Undertaker Who Was a Member 
of a Trust, &ldquo;this is a most hateful and injurious 
scheme.&nbsp; If people cannot be assured of graves, I fear they 
will no longer die, and the best interests of civilisation will 
wither like a frosted leaf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And blowing his eyes upon his handkerchief, he walked away 
lamenting.</p>
<h2>The Crew of the Life-boat</h2>
<p>The Gallant Crew at a life-saving station were about to launch
their life-boat for a spin along the coast when they discovered, 
but a little distance away, a capsized vessel with a dozen men 
clinging to her keel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are fortunate,&rdquo; said the Gallant Crew, 
&ldquo;to have seen that in time.&nbsp; Our fate might have been 
the same as theirs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they hauled the life-boat back into its house, and were 
spared to the service of their country.</p>
<h2>A Treaty of Peace</h2>
<p>Through massacres of each other&rsquo;s citizens China and the
United States had been four times plunged into devastating wars, 
when, in the year 1994, arose a Philosopher in Madagascar, who 
laid before the Governments of the two distracted countries the 
following <i>modus vivendi</i>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Massacres are to be sternly forbidden as heretofore; 
but any citizen or subject of either country disobeying the 
injunction is to detach the scalps of all persons massacred and 
deposit them with a local officer designated to receive and 
preserve them and sworn to keep and render a true account 
thereof.&nbsp; At the conclusion of each massacre in either 
country, or as soon thereafter as practicable, or at stated 
regular periods, as may be provided by treaty, there shall be an 
exchange of scalps between the two Governments, scalp for scalp, 
without regard to sex or age; the Government having the greatest 
number is to be taxed on the excess at the rate of $1000 a scalp,
and the other Government credited with the amount.&nbsp; Once in 
every decade there shall be a general settlement, when the 
balance due shall be paid to the creditor nation in Mexican 
dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The plan was adopted, the necessary treaty made, with 
legislation to carry out its provisions; the Madagascarene 
Philosopher took his seat in the Temple of Immortality, and Peace
spread her white wings over the two nations, to the unspeakable 
defiling of her plumage.</p>
<h2>The Nightside of Character</h2>
<p>A Gifted and Honourable Editor, who by practice of his 
profession had acquired wealth and distinction, applied to an Old
Friend for the hand of his daughter in marriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart, and God bless you!&rdquo; said the 
Old Friend, grasping him by both hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a 
greater honour than I had dared to hope for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew what your answer would be,&rdquo; replied the 
Gifted and Honourable Editor.&nbsp; &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he 
added, with a sly smile, &ldquo;I feel that I ought to give you 
as much knowledge of my character as I possess.&nbsp; In this 
scrap-book is such testimony relating to my shady side, as I have
within the past ten years been able to cut from the columns of my
competitors in the business of elevating humanity to a higher 
plane of mind and morals&mdash;my &lsquo;loathsome 
contemporaries.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laying the book on a table, he withdrew in high spirits to 
make arrangements for the wedding.&nbsp; Three days later he 
received the scrap-book from a messenger, with a note warning him
never again to darken his Old Friend&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; the Gifted and Honourable Editor exclaimed,
pointing to that injunction&mdash;&ldquo;I am a painter and 
grainer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he was led away to the Asylum for the Indiscreet.</p>
<h2>The Faithful Cashier</h2>
<p>The Cashier of a bank having defaulted was asked by the 
Directors what he had done with the money taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am greatly surprised by such a question,&rdquo; said 
the Cashier; &ldquo;it sounds as if you suspected me of 
selfishness.&nbsp; Gentlemen, I applied that money to the purpose
for which I took it; I paid it as an initiation fee and one 
year&rsquo;s dues in advance to the Treasurer of the 
Cashiers&rsquo; Mutual Defence Association.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the object of that organisation?&rdquo; the 
Directors inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When any one of its members is under suspicion,&rdquo; 
replied the Cashier, &ldquo;the Association undertakes to clear 
his character by submitting evidence that he was never a 
prominent member of any church, nor foremost in Sunday-school 
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Recognising the value to the bank of a spotless reputation for
its officers, the President drew his check for the amount of the 
shortage and the Cashier was restored to favour.</p>
<h2>The Circular Clew</h2>
<p>A Detective searching for the murderer of a dead man was 
accosted by a Clew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; said the Clew, &ldquo;and 
there&rsquo;s no knowing what you may discover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Detective followed the Clew a whole year through a 
thousand sinuosities, and at last found himself in the office of 
the Morgue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said the Clew, pointing to the open 
register.</p>
<p>The Detective eagerly scanned the page, and found an official 
statement that the deceased was dead.&nbsp; Thereupon he hastened
to Police Headquarters to report progress.&nbsp; The Clew, 
meanwhile, sauntered among the busy haunts of men, arm in arm 
with an Ingenious Theory.</p>
<h2>The Devoted Widow</h2>
<p>A Widow weeping on her husband&rsquo;s grave was approached by
an Engaging Gentleman who, in a respectful manner, assured her 
that he had long entertained for her the most tender 
feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wretch!&rdquo; cried the Widow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Leave me 
this instant!&nbsp; Is this a time to talk to me of 
love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you, madam, that I had not intended to 
disclose my affection,&rdquo; the Engaging Gentleman humbly 
explained, &ldquo;but the power of your beauty has overcome my 
discretion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should see me when I have not been crying,&rdquo; 
said the Widow.</p>
<h2>The Hardy Patriots</h2>
<p>A Dispenser-Elect of Patronage gave notice through the 
newspapers that applicants for places would be given none until 
he should assume the duties of his office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are exposing yourself to a grave danger,&rdquo; 
said a Lawyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; the Dispenser-Elect inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be nearly two months,&rdquo; the Lawyer 
answered, &ldquo;before the day that you mention.&nbsp; Few 
patriots can live so long without eating, and some of the 
applicants will be compelled to go to work in the meantime.&nbsp;
If that kills them, you will be liable to prosecution for 
murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You underrate their powers of endurance,&rdquo; the 
official replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said the Lawyer, &ldquo;you think they can
stand work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the 
other&mdash;&ldquo;hunger.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Humble Peasant</h2>
<p>An Office Seeker whom the President had ordered out of 
Washington was watering the homeward highway with his tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how disastrous is ambition! 
how unsatisfying its rewards! how terrible its 
disappointments!&nbsp; Behold yonder peasant tilling his field in
peace and contentment!&nbsp; He rises with the lark, passes the 
day in wholesome toil, and lies down at night to pleasant 
dreams.&nbsp; In the mad struggle for place and power he has no 
part; the roar of the strife reaches his ear like the distant 
murmur of the ocean.&nbsp; Happy, thrice happy man!&nbsp; I will 
approach him and bask in the sunshine of his humble 
felicity.&nbsp; Peasant, all hail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaning upon his rake, the Peasant returned the salutation 
with a nod, but said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said the Office Seeker, &ldquo;you 
see before you the wreck of an ambitious man&mdash;ruined by the 
pursuit of place and power.&nbsp; This morning when I set out 
from the national capital&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stranger,&rdquo; the Peasant interrupted, &ldquo;if 
you&rsquo;re going back there soon maybe you wouldn&rsquo;t mind 
using your influence to make me Postmaster at Smith&rsquo;s 
Corners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The traveller passed on.</p>
<h2>The Various Delegation</h2>
<p>The King of Wideout having been offered the sovereignty of 
Wayoff, sent for the Three Persons who had made the offer, and 
said to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am extremely obliged to you, but before accepting so 
great a responsibility I must ascertain the sentiments of the 
people of Wayoff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said the Spokesman of the Three Persons, 
&ldquo;they stand before you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said the King; &ldquo;are you, then, the
people of Wayoff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are not many of you,&rdquo; the King said, 
attentively regarding them with the royal eye, &ldquo;and you are
not so very large; I hardly think you are a quorum.&nbsp; 
Moreover, I never heard of you until you came here; whereas 
Wayoff is noted for the quality of its pork and contains hogs of 
distinction.&nbsp; I shall send a Commissioner to ascertain the 
sentiments of the hogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Three Persons, bowing profoundly, backed out of the 
presence; but soon afterward they desired another audience, and, 
on being readmitted, said, through their Spokesman:</p>
<p>&ldquo;May it please your Majesty, we are the hogs.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The No Case</h2>
<p>A Statesman who had been indicted by an unfeeling Grand Jury 
was arrested by a Sheriff and thrown into jail.&nbsp; As this was
abhorrent to his fine spiritual nature, he sent for the District 
Attorney and asked that the case against him be dismissed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon what grounds?&rdquo; asked the District 
Attorney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lack of evidence to convict,&rdquo; replied the 
accused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you happen to have the lack with you?&rdquo; the 
official asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should like to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;here it 
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying he handed the other a check, which the District 
Attorney carefully examined, and then pronounced it the most 
complete absence of both proof and presumption that he had ever 
seen.&nbsp; He said it would acquit the oldest man in the 
world.</p>
<h2>A Harmless Visitor</h2>
<p>At a meeting of the Golden League of Mystery a Woman was 
discovered, writing in a note-book.&nbsp; A member directed the 
attention of the Superb High Chairman to her, and she was asked 
to explain her presence there, and what she was doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came in for my own pleasure and instruction,&rdquo; 
she said, &ldquo;and was so struck by the wisdom of the speakers 
that I could not help making a few notes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said the Superb High Chairman, &ldquo;we 
have no objection to visitors if they will pledge themselves not 
to publish anything they hear.&nbsp; Are you&mdash;on your honour
as a lady, now, madam&mdash;are you not connected with some 
newspaper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, no!&rdquo; cried the Woman, 
earnestly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, sir, I am an officer of the 
Women&rsquo;s Press Association!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was permitted to remain, and presented with resolutions of
apology.</p>
<h2>The Judge and the Rash Act</h2>
<p>A Judge who had for years looked in vain for an opportunity 
for infamous distinction, but whom no litigant thought worth 
bribing, sat one day upon the Bench, lamenting his hard lot, and 
threatening to put an end to his life if business did not 
improve.&nbsp; Suddenly he found himself confronted by a dreadful
figure clad in a shroud, whose pallor and stony eyes smote him 
with a horrible apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you,&rdquo; he faltered, &ldquo;and why do you 
come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the Rash Act,&rdquo; was the sepulchral reply; 
&ldquo;you may commit me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the judge said, thoughtfully, &ldquo;no, 
that would be quite irregular.&nbsp; I do not sit to-day as a 
committing magistrate.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Prerogative of Might</h2>
<p>A Slander travelling rapidly through the land upon its joyous 
mission was accosted by a Retraction and commanded to halt and be
killed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your career of mischief is at an end,&rdquo; said the 
Retraction, drawing his club, rolling up his sleeves, and 
spitting on his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should you slay me?&rdquo; protested the 
Slander.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whatever my intentions were, I have been 
innocuous, for you have dogged my strides and counteracted my 
influence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dogged your grandmother!&rdquo; said the Retraction, 
with contemptuous vulgarity of speech.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the order 
of nature it is appointed that we two shall never travel the same
road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How then,&rdquo; the Slander asked, triumphantly, 
&ldquo;have you overtaken me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not,&rdquo; replied the Retraction; &ldquo;we 
have accidentally met.&nbsp; I came round the world the other 
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when he tried to execute his fell purpose he found that in
the order of nature it was appointed that he himself perish 
miserably in the encounter.</p>
<h2>An Inflated Ambition</h2>
<p>The President of a great Corporation went into a dry-goods 
shop and saw a placard which read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If You Don&rsquo;t See What You Want, Ask For 
It.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Approaching the shopkeeper, who had been narrowly observing 
him as he read the placard, he was about to speak, when the 
shopkeeper called to a salesman:</p>
<p>&ldquo;John, show this gentleman the world.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Rejected Services</h2>
<p>A Heavy Operator overtaken by a Reverse of Fortune was 
bewailing his sudden fall from affluence to indigence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not weep,&rdquo; said the Reverse of Fortune.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;You need not suffer alone.&nbsp; Name any one of the men 
who have opposed your schemes, and I will overtake 
<i>him</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is hardly worth while,&rdquo; said the victim, 
earnestly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not a soul of them has a cent!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Power of the Scalawag</h2>
<p>A Forestry Commissioner had just felled a giant tree when, 
seeing an honest man approaching, he dropped his axe and 
fled.&nbsp; The next day when he cautiously returned to get his 
axe, he found the following lines pencilled on the stump:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What nature reared by centuries of toil,<br
/>
A scalawag in half a day can spoil;<br />
An equal fate for him may Heaven provide&mdash;<br />
Damned in the moment of his tallest pride.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>At Large&mdash;One Temper</h2>
<p>A Turbulent Person was brought before a Judge to be tried for 
an assault with intent to commit murder, and it was proved that 
he had been variously obstreperous without apparent provocation, 
had affected the peripheries of several luckless fellow-citizens 
with the trunk of a small tree, and subsequently cleaned out the 
town.&nbsp; While trying to palliate these misdeeds, the 
defendant&rsquo;s Attorney turned suddenly to the Judge, 
saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did your Honour ever lose your temper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fine you twenty-five dollars for contempt of 
court!&rdquo; roared the Judge, in wrath.&nbsp; &ldquo;How dare 
you mention the loss of my temper in connection with this 
case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s silence the Attorney said, meekly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought my client might perhaps have found 
it.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Seeker and the Sought</h2>
<p>A Politician seeing a fat Turkey which he wanted for dinner, 
baited a hook with a grain of corn and dragged it before the fowl
at the end of a long and almost invisible line.&nbsp; When the 
Turkey had swallowed the hook, the Politician ran, drawing the 
creature after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellow-citizens,&rdquo; he cried, addressing some 
turkey-breeders whom he met, &ldquo;you observe that the man does
not seek the bird, but the bird seeks the man.&nbsp; For this 
unsolicited and unexpected dinner I thank you with all my 
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>His Fly-Speck Majesty</h2>
<p>A Distinguished Advocate of Republican Institutions was seen 
pickling his shins in the ocean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come out on dry land?&rdquo; said 
the Spectator.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you in there for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied the Distinguished Advocate of 
Republican Institutions, &ldquo;a ship is expected, bearing His 
Majesty the King of the Fly-Speck Islands, and I wish to be the 
first to grasp the crowned hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the Spectator, &ldquo;you said in your
famous speech before the Society for the Prevention of the 
Protrusion of Nail Heads from Plank Sidewalks that Kings were 
blood-smeared oppressors and hell-bound loafers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; said the Distinguished Advocate of 
Republican Institutions, without removing his eyes from the 
horizon, &ldquo;you wander away into the strangest 
irrelevancies!&nbsp; I spoke of Kings in the abstract.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Pugilist&rsquo;s Diet</h2>
<p>The Trainer of a Pugilist consulted a Physician regarding the 
champion&rsquo;s diet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beef-steaks are too tender,&rdquo; said the Physician; 
&ldquo;have his meat cut from the neck of a bull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought the steaks more digestible,&rdquo; the 
Trainer explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very true,&rdquo; said the Physician; 
&ldquo;but they do not sufficiently exercise the chin.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Old Man and the Pupil</h2>
<p>A Beautiful Old Man, meeting a Sunday-school Pupil, laid his 
hand tenderly upon the lad&rsquo;s head, saying: &ldquo;Listen, 
my son, to the words of the wise and heed the advice of the 
righteous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the Sunday-school Pupil; 
&ldquo;go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I haven&rsquo;t anything to do with it 
myself,&rdquo; said the Beautiful Old Man.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am only
observing one of the customs of the age.&nbsp; I am a 
pirate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when he had taken his hand from the lad&rsquo;s head, the 
latter observed that his hair was full of clotted blood.&nbsp; 
Then the Beautiful Old Man went his way, instructing other 
youth.</p>
<h2>The Deceased and his Heirs</h2>
<p>A Man died leaving a large estate and many sorrowful relations
who claimed it.&nbsp; After some years, when all but one had had 
judgment given against them, that one was awarded the estate, 
which he asked his Attorney to have appraised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing to appraise,&rdquo; said the Attorney,
pocketing his last fee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the Successful Claimant, &ldquo;what 
good has all this litigation done me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been a good client to me,&rdquo; the Attorney 
replied, gathering up his books and papers, &ldquo;but I must say
you betray a surprising ignorance of the purpose of 
litigation.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Politicians and the Plunder</h2>
<p>Several Political Entities were dividing the spoils.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take the management of the prisons,&rdquo; said 
a Decent Respect for Public Opinion, &ldquo;and make a radical 
change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said the Blotted Escutcheon, &ldquo;will 
retain my present general connection with affairs, while my 
friend here, the Soiled Ermine, will remain in the 
Judiciary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Political Pot said it would not boil any more unless 
replenished from the Filthy Pool.</p>
<p>The Cohesive Power of Public Plunder quietly remarked that the
two bosses would, he supposed, naturally be his share.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Depth of Degradation, &ldquo;they 
have already fallen to me.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Man and the Wart</h2>
<p>A Person with a Wart on His Nose met a Person Similarly 
Afflicted, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me propose your name for membership in the Imperial
Order of Abnormal Proboscidians, of which I am the High Noble 
Toby and Surreptitious Treasurer.&nbsp; Two months ago I was the 
only member.&nbsp; One month ago there were two.&nbsp; To-day we 
number four Emperors of the Abnormal Proboscis in good 
standing&mdash;doubles every four weeks, see?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s 
geometrical progression&mdash;you know how that piles up.&nbsp; 
In a year and a half every man in California will have a wart on 
his Nose.&nbsp; Powerful Order!&nbsp; Initiation, five 
dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said the Person Similarly Afflicted, 
&ldquo;here are five dollars.&nbsp; Keep my name off your 
books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you kindly,&rdquo; the Man with a Wart on His 
Nose replied, pocketing the money; &ldquo;it is just the same to 
us as if you joined.&nbsp; Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went away, but in a little while he was back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I quite forgot to mention the monthly dues,&rdquo; he 
said.</p>
<h2>The Divided Delegation</h2>
<p>A Delegation at Washington went to a New President, and 
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Excellency, we are unable to agree upon a 
Favourite Son to represent us in your Cabinet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the New President, &ldquo;I shall 
have to lock you up until you do agree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Delegation was cast into the deepest dungeon beneath 
the moat, where it maintained a divided mind for many weeks, but 
finally reconciled its differences and asked to be taken before 
the New President.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;nothing is so 
beautiful as harmony.&nbsp; My Cabinet Selections were all made 
before our former interview, but you have supplied a noble 
instance of patriotism in subordinating your personal preferences
to the general good.&nbsp; Go now to your beautiful homes and be 
happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not recorded that the Delegation was happy.</p>
<h2>A Forfeited Right</h2>
<p>The Chief of the Weather Bureau having predicted a fine day, a
Thrifty Person hastened to lay in a large stock of umbrellas, 
which he exposed for sale on the sidewalk; but the weather 
remained clear, and nobody would buy.&nbsp; Thereupon the Thrifty
Person brought an action against the Chief of the Weather Bureau 
for the cost of the umbrellas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Honour,&rdquo; said the defendant&rsquo;s 
attorney, when the case was called, &ldquo;I move that this 
astonishing action be dismissed.&nbsp; Not only is my client in 
no way responsible for the loss, but he distinctly foreshadowed 
the very thing that caused it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just it, your Honour,&rdquo; replied the 
counsel for the plaintiff; &ldquo;the defendant by making a 
correct forecast fooled my client in the only way that he could 
do so.&nbsp; He has lied so much and so notoriously that he has 
neither the legal nor moral right to tell the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>
<h2>Revenge</h2>
<p>An Insurance Agent was trying to induce a Hard Man to Deal 
With to take out a policy on his house.&nbsp; After listening to 
him for an hour, while he painted in vivid colours the extreme 
danger of fire consuming the house, the Hard Man to Deal With 
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think it likely that my house will burn 
down inside the time that policy will run?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied the Insurance Agent; 
&ldquo;have I not been trying all this time to convince you that 
I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the Hard Man to Deal With, &ldquo;why
are you so anxious to have your Company bet me money that it will
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Agent was silent and thoughtful for a moment; then he drew
the other apart into an unfrequented place and whispered in his 
ear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend, I will impart to you a dark secret.&nbsp; 
Years ago the Company betrayed my sweetheart by promise of 
marriage.&nbsp; Under an assumed name I have wormed myself into 
its service for revenge; and as there is a heaven above us, I 
will have its heart&rsquo;s blood!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>An Optimist</h2>
<p>Two Frogs in the belly of a snake were considering their 
altered circumstances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is pretty hard luck,&rdquo; said one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t jump to conclusions,&rdquo; the other said;
&ldquo;we are out of the wet and provided with board and 
lodging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With lodging, certainly,&rdquo; said the First Frog; 
&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t see the board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a croaker,&rdquo; the other explained.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;We are ourselves the board.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>A Valuable Suggestion</h2>
<p>A Big Nation having a quarrel with a Little Nation, resolved 
to terrify its antagonist by a grand naval demonstration in the 
latter&rsquo;s principal port.&nbsp; So the Big Nation assembled 
all its ships of war from all over the world, and was about to 
send them three hundred and fifty thousand miles to the place of 
rendezvous, when the President of the Big Nation received the 
following note from the President of the Little Nation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My great and good friend, I hear that you are going to 
show us your navy, in order to impress us with a sense of your 
power.&nbsp; How needless the expense!&nbsp; To prove to you that
we already know all about it, I inclose herewith a list and 
description of all the ships you have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great and good friend was so struck by the hard sense of 
the letter that he kept his navy at home, and saved one thousand 
million dollars.&nbsp; This economy enabled him to buy a 
satisfactory decision when the cause of the quarrel was submitted
to arbitration.</p>
<h2>Two Footpads</h2>
<p>Two Footpads sat at their grog in a roadside resort, comparing
the evening&rsquo;s adventures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stood up the Chief of Police,&rdquo; said the First 
Footpad, &ldquo;and I got away with what he had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said the Second Footpad, &ldquo;stood up 
the United States District Attorney, and got away 
with&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; interrupted the other in astonishment
and admiration&mdash;&ldquo;you got away with what that fellow 
had?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the unfortunate narrator 
explained&mdash;&ldquo;with a small part of what <i>I</i> 
had.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Equipped for Service</h2>
<p>During the Civil War a Patriot was passing through the State 
of Maryland with a pass from the President to join Grant&rsquo;s 
army and see the fighting.&nbsp; Stopping a day at Annapolis, he 
visited the shop of a well-known optician and ordered seven 
powerful telescopes, one for every day in the week.&nbsp; In 
recognition of this munificent patronage of the State&rsquo;s 
languishing industries, the Governor commissioned him a 
colonel.</p>
<h2>The Basking Cyclone</h2>
<p>A Negro in a boat, gathering driftwood, saw a sleeping 
Alligator, and, thinking it was a log, fell to estimating the 
number of shingles it would make for his new cabin.&nbsp; Having 
satisfied his mind on that point, he stuck his boat-hook into the
beast&rsquo;s back to harvest his good fortune.&nbsp; Thereupon 
the saurian emerged from his dream and took to the water, greatly
to the surprise of the man-and-brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never befo&rsquo; seen such a cyclone as dat,&rdquo; 
he exclaimed as soon as he had recovered his breath.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;It done carry away de ruf of my house!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>At the Pole</h2>
<p>After a great expenditure of life and treasure a Daring 
Explorer had succeeded in reaching the North Pole, when he was 
approached by a Native Galeut who lived there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said the Native Galeut.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I&lsquo;m very glad to see you, but why did you come 
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glory,&rdquo; said the Daring Explorer, curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I know,&rdquo; the other persisted; 
&ldquo;but of what benefit to man is your discovery?&nbsp; To 
what truths does it give access which were inaccessible 
before?&mdash;facts, I mean, having a scientific 
value?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&lsquo;ll be Tom scatted if I know,&rdquo; the great 
man replied, frankly; &ldquo;you will have to ask the Scientist 
of the Expedition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Scientist of the Expedition explained that he had been
so engrossed with the care of his instruments and the study of 
his tables that he had found no time to think of it.</p>
<h2>The Optimist and the Cynic</h2>
<p>A Man who had experienced the favours of fortune and was an 
Optimist, met a man who had experienced an optimist and was a 
Cynic.&nbsp; So the Cynic turned out of the road to let the 
Optimist roll by in his gold carriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said the Optimist, stopping the gold 
carriage, &ldquo;you look as if you had not a friend in the 
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I have or not,&rdquo; replied the
Cynic, &ldquo;for you have the world.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Poet and the Editor</h2>
<p>&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; said the editor to the man, who had
called to see about his poem, &ldquo;I regret to say that owing 
to an unfortunate altercation in this office the greater part of 
your manuscript is illegible; a bottle of ink was upset upon it, 
blotting out all but the first line&mdash;that is to 
say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The autumn leaves were falling, 
falling.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unluckily, not having read the poem, I was unable to 
supply the incidents that followed; otherwise we could have given
them in our own words.&nbsp; If the news is not stale, and has 
not already appeared in the other papers, perhaps you will kindly
relate what occurred, while I make notes of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The autumn leaves were falling, 
falling,&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said the poet, &ldquo;do you expect me to 
reproduce the entire poem from memory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the substance of it&mdash;just the leading 
facts.&nbsp; We will add whatever is necessary in the way of 
amplification and embellishment.&nbsp; It will detain you but a 
moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The autumn leaves were falling, 
falling&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a sound of a slow getting up and going away.&nbsp; 
The chronicler of passing events sat through it, motionless, with
suspended pen; and when the movement was complete Poesy was 
represented in that place by nothing but a warm spot on the 
wooden chair.</p>
<h2>The Taken Hand</h2>
<p>A Successful Man of Business, having occasion to write to a 
Thief, expressed a wish to see him and shake hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the Thief, &ldquo;there are some 
things which I will not take&mdash;among them your 
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must use a little strategy,&rdquo; said a 
Philosopher to whom the Successful Man of Business had reported 
the Thief&rsquo;s haughty reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Leave your hand out
some night, and he will take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So one night the Successful Man of Business left his hand out 
of his neighbour&rsquo;s pocket, and the Thief took it with 
avidity.</p>
<h2>An Unspeakable Imbecile</h2>
<p>A Judge said to a Convicted Assassin:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prisoner at the bar, have you anything to say why the 
death-sentence should not be passed upon you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will what I say make any difference?&rdquo; asked the 
Convicted Assassin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not see how it can,&rdquo; the Judge answered, 
reflectively.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, it will not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the doomed one, &ldquo;I should just 
like to remark that you are the most unspeakable old imbecile in 
seven States and the District of Columbia.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>A Needful War</h2>
<p>The people of Madagonia had an antipathy to the people of 
Novakatka and set upon some sailors of a Novakatkan vessel, 
killing two and wounding twelve.&nbsp; The King of Madagonia 
having refused either to apologise or pay, the King of Novakatka 
made war upon him, saying that it was necessary to show that 
Novakatkans must not be slaughtered.&nbsp; In the battles which 
ensued the people of Madagonia slaughtered two thousand 
Novakatkans and wounded twelve thousand.&nbsp; But the 
Madagonians were unsuccessful, which so chagrined them that never
thereafter in all their land was a Novakatkan secure in property 
or life.</p>
<h2>The Mine Owner and the Jackass</h2>
<p>While the Owner of a Silver Mine was on his way to attend a 
convention of his species he was accosted by a Jackass, who 
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By an unjust discrimination against quadrupeds I am 
made ineligible to a seat in your convention; so I am compelled 
to seek representation through you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will give me great pleasure, sir,&rdquo; said the 
Owner of a Silver Mine, &ldquo;to serve one so closely allied to 
me in&mdash;in&mdash;well, you know,&rdquo; he added, with a 
significant gesture of his two hands upward from the sides of his
head.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing&mdash;nothing at all for myself 
individually,&rdquo; replied the Donkey; &ldquo;but his 
country&rsquo;s welfare should be a patriot&rsquo;s supreme 
care.&nbsp; If Americans are to retain the sacred liberties for 
which their fathers strove, Congress must declare our 
independence of European dictation by maintaining the price of 
mules.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Dog and the Physician</h2>
<p>A Dog that had seen a Physician attending the burial of a 
wealthy patient, said: &ldquo;When do you expect to dig it 
up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I dig it up?&rdquo; the Physician asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I bury a bone,&rdquo; said the Dog, &ldquo;it is 
with an intention to uncover it later and pick it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bones that I bury,&rdquo; said the Physician, 
&ldquo;are those that I can no longer pick.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Party Manager and the Gentleman</h2>
<p>A Party Manager said to a Gentleman whom he saw minding his 
own business:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much will you pay for a nomination to 
office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; the Gentleman replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will contribute something to the campaign fund 
to assist in your election, will you not?&rdquo; asked the Party 
Manager, winking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said the Gentleman, gravely.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;If the people wish me to work for them, they must hire me 
without solicitation.&nbsp; I am very comfortable without 
office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; urged the Party Manager, &ldquo;an election
is a thing to be desired.&nbsp; It is a high honour to be a 
servant of the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If servitude is a high honour,&rdquo; the Gentleman 
said, &ldquo;it would be indecent for me to seek it; and if 
obtained by my own exertion it would be no honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; persisted the Party Manager, &ldquo;you 
will at least, I hope, indorse the party platform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Gentleman replied: &ldquo;It is improbable that its 
authors have accurately expressed my views without consulting me;
and if I indorsed their work without approving it I should be a 
liar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a detestable hypocrite and an idiot!&rdquo; 
shouted the Party Manager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even your good opinion of my fitness,&rdquo; replied 
the Gentleman, &ldquo;shall not persuade me.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Legislator and the Citizen</h2>
<p>An ex-Legislator asked a Most Respectable Citizen for a letter
to the Governor recommending him for appointment as Commissioner 
of Shrimps and Crabs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the Most Respectable Citizen, 
austerely, &ldquo;were you not once in the State 
Senate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so bad as that, sir, I assure you,&rdquo; was the 
reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was a member of the Slower House.&nbsp; I 
was expelled for selling my influence for money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you dare to ask for mine!&rdquo; shouted the Most 
Respectable Citizen.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have the impudence?&nbsp; A
man who will accept bribes will probably offer them.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Do you mean to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should not think of making a corrupt proposal to you,
sir; but if I were Commissioner of Shrimps and Crabs, I might 
have some influence with the water-front population, and be able 
to help you make your fight for Coroner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case I do not feel justified in denying you the
letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he took his pen, and, some demon guiding his hand, he 
wrote, greatly to his astonishment:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Who sells his influence should stop it,<br 
/>
An honest man will only swap it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Rainmaker</h2>
<p>An Officer of the Government, with a great outfit of 
mule-waggons loaded with balloons, kites, dynamite bombs, and 
electrical apparatus, halted in the midst of a desert, where 
there had been no rain for ten years, and set up a camp.&nbsp; 
After several months of preparation and an expenditure of a 
million dollars all was in readiness, and a series of tremendous 
explosions occurred on the earth and in the sky.&nbsp; This was 
followed by a great down-pour of rain, which washed the 
unfortunate Officer of the Government and the outfit off the face
of creation and affected the agricultural heart with joy too deep
for utterance.&nbsp; A Newspaper Reporter who had just arrived 
escaped by climbing a hill near by, and there he found the Sole 
Survivor of the expedition&mdash;a mule-driver&mdash;down on his 
knees behind a mesquite bush, praying with extreme fervour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t stop it that way,&rdquo; said the 
Reporter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My fellow-traveller to the bar of God,&rdquo; replied 
the Sole Survivor, looking up over his shoulder, &ldquo;your 
understanding is in darkness.&nbsp; I am not stopping this great 
blessing; under Providence, I am bringing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a pretty good joke,&rdquo; said the Reporter, 
laughing as well as he could in the strangling 
rain&mdash;&ldquo;a mule driver&rsquo;s prayer 
answered!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Child of levity and scoffing,&rdquo; replied the other;
&ldquo;you err again, misled by these humble habiliments.&nbsp; I
am the Rev. Ezekiel Thrifft, a minister of the gospel, now in the
service of the great manufacturing firm of Skinn &amp; 
Sheer.&nbsp; They make balloons, kites, dynamite bombs, and 
electrical apparatus.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Citizen and the Snakes</h2>
<p>A Public-Spirited Citizen who had failed miserably in trying 
to secure a National political convention for his city suffered 
acutely from dejection.&nbsp; While in that frame of mind he 
leaned thoughtlessly against a druggist&rsquo;s show-window, 
wherein were one hundred and fifty kinds of assorted 
snakes.&nbsp; The glass breaking, the reptiles all escaped into 
the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you can&rsquo;t do what you wish,&rdquo; said the 
Public-spirited Citizen, &ldquo;it is worth while to do what you 
can.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Fortune and the Fabulist</h2>
<p>A Writer of Fables was passing through a lonely forest when he
met a Fortune.&nbsp; Greatly alarmed, he tried to climb a tree, 
but the Fortune pulled him down and bestowed itself upon him with
cruel persistence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you try to run away?&rdquo; said the Fortune, 
when his struggles had ceased and his screams were stilled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why do you glare at me so inhospitably?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you are,&rdquo; replied the 
Writer of Fables, deeply disturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am wealth; I am respectability,&rdquo; the Fortune 
explained; &ldquo;I am elegant houses, a yacht, and a clean shirt
every day.&nbsp; I am leisure, I am travel, wine, a shiny hat, 
and an unshiny coat.&nbsp; I am enough to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the Writer of Fables, in a 
whisper; &ldquo;but for goodness&rsquo; sake speak 
lower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; the Fortune asked, in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So as not to wake me,&rdquo; replied the Writer of 
Fables, a holy calm brooding upon his beautiful face.</p>
<h2>A Smiling Idol</h2>
<p>An Idol said to a Missionary, &ldquo;My friend, why do you 
seek to bring me into contempt?&nbsp; If it had not been for me, 
what would you have been?&nbsp; Remember thy creator that thy 
days be long in the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I confess,&rdquo; replied the Missionary, fingering a 
number of ten-cent pieces which a Sunday-school in his own 
country had forwarded to him, &ldquo;that I am a product of you, 
but I protest that you cannot quote Scripture with accuracy and 
point.&nbsp; Therefore will I continue to go up against you with 
the Sword of the Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards the Idol&rsquo;s worshippers held a great 
religious ceremony at the base of his pedestal, and as a part of 
the rites the Missionary was roasted whole.&nbsp; As the tongue 
was removed for the high priest&rsquo;s table, &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; 
said the Idol to himself, &ldquo;that is the Sword of the 
Spirit&mdash;the only Sword that is less dangerous when 
unsheathed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he smiled so pleasantly at his own wit that the provinces 
of Ghargaroo, M&rsquo;gwana, and Scowow were affected with a 
blight.</p>
<h2>Philosophers Three</h2>
<p>A Bear, a Fox, and an Opossum were attacked by an 
inundation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Death loves a coward,&rdquo; said the Bear, and went 
forward to fight the flood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a fool!&rdquo; said the Fox.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know a
trick worth two of that.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he slipped into a 
hollow stump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are malevolent forces,&rdquo; said the Opossum, 
&ldquo;which the wise will neither confront nor avoid.&nbsp; The 
thing is to know the nature of your antagonist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying the Opossum lay down and pretended to be dead.</p>
<h2>The Boneless King</h2>
<p>Some Apes who had deposed their king fell at once into 
dissension and anarchy.&nbsp; In this strait they sent a 
Deputation to a neighbouring tribe to consult the Oldest and 
Wisest Ape in All the World.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My children,&rdquo; said the Oldest and Wisest Ape in 
All the World, when he had heard the Deputation, &ldquo;you did 
right in ridding yourselves of tyranny, but your tribe is not 
sufficiently advanced to dispense with the forms of 
monarchy.&nbsp; Entice the tyrant back with fair promises, kill 
him and enthrone.&nbsp; The skeleton of even the most lawless 
despot makes a good constitutional sovereign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this the Deputation was greatly abashed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
impossible,&rdquo; they said, moving away; &ldquo;our king has no
skeleton; he was stuffed.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Uncalculating Zeal</h2>
<p>A Man-Eating tiger was ravaging the Kingdom of Damnasia, and 
the King, greatly concerned for the lives and limbs of his Royal 
subjects, promised his daughter Zodroulra to any man who would 
kill the animal.&nbsp; After some days Camaraladdin appeared 
before the King and claimed the reward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where is the tiger?&rdquo; the King asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May jackasses sing above my uncle&rsquo;s grave,&rdquo;
replied Camaraladdin, &ldquo;if I dared go within a league of 
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wretch!&rdquo; cried the King, unsheathing his 
consoler-under-disappointment; &ldquo;how dare you claim my 
daughter when you have done nothing to earn her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art wiser, O King, than Solyman the Great, and thy
servant is as dust in the tomb of thy dog, yet thou errest.&nbsp;
I did not, it is true, kill the tiger, but behold!&nbsp; I have 
brought thee the scalp of the man who had accumulated five 
million pieces of gold and was after more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King drew his consoler-under-disappointment, and, flicking
off Camaraladdin&rsquo;s head, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Learn, caitiff, the expediency of uncalculating 
zeal.&nbsp; If the millionaire had been let alone he would have 
devoured the tiger.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>A Transposition</h2>
<p>Travelling through the sage-brush country a Jackass met a 
rabbit, who exclaimed in great astonishment:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens! how did you grow so big?&nbsp; You are 
doubtless the largest rabbit living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Jackass, &ldquo;you are the 
smallest donkey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a good deal of fruitless argument the question was 
referred for decision to a passing Coyote, who was a bit of a 
demagogue and desirous to stand well with both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are both right, 
as was to have been expected by persons so gifted with appliances
for receiving instruction from the wise.&nbsp; You, 
sir,&rdquo;&mdash;turning to the superior 
animal&mdash;&ldquo;are, as he has accurately observed, a 
rabbit.&nbsp; And you&rdquo;&mdash;to the other&mdash;&ldquo;are 
correctly described as a jackass.&nbsp; In transposing your names
man has acted with incredible folly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were so pleased with the decision that they declared the 
Coyote their candidate for the Grizzly Bearship; but whether he 
ever obtained the office history does not relate.</p>
<h2>The Honest Citizen</h2>
<p>A Political Preferment, labelled with its price, was 
canvassing the State to find a purchaser.&nbsp; One day it 
offered itself to a Truly Good Man, who, after examining the 
label and finding the price was exactly twice as great as he was 
willing to pay, spurned the Political Preferment from his 
door.&nbsp; Then the People said: &ldquo;Behold, this is an 
honest citizen!&rdquo;&nbsp; And the Truly Good Man humbly 
confessed that it was so.</p>
<h2>A Creaking Tail</h2>
<p>An American Statesman who had twisted the tail of the British 
Lion until his arms ached was at last rewarded by a sharp, 
rasping sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew your fortitude would give out after a 
while,&rdquo; said the American Statesman, delighted; &ldquo;your
agony attests my political power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agony I know not!&rdquo; said the British Lion, 
yawning; &ldquo;the swivel in my tail needs a few drops of oil, 
that is all.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Wasted Sweets</h2>
<p>A Candidate canvassing his district met a Nurse wheeling a 
Baby in a carriage, and, stooping, imprinted a kiss upon the 
Baby&rsquo;s clammy muzzle.&nbsp; Rising, he saw a Man, who 
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you laugh?&rdquo; asked the Candidate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied the Man, &ldquo;the Baby 
belongs to the Orphan Asylum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Nurse,&rdquo; said the 
Candidate&mdash;&ldquo;the Nurse will surely relate the touching 
incident wherever she goes, and perhaps write to her former 
master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Nurse,&rdquo; said the Man who had laughed, 
&ldquo;is an inmate of the Institution for the 
Illiterate-Deaf-and-Dumb.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Six and One</h2>
<p>The Committee on Gerrymander worked late, drawing intricate 
lines on a map of the State, and being weary sought repose in a 
game of poker.&nbsp; At the close of the game the six Republican 
members were bankrupt and the single Democrat had all the 
money.&nbsp; On the next day, when the Committee was called to 
order for business, one of the luckless six mounted his legs, and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman, before we bend to our noble task of 
purifying politics, in the interest of good government I wish to 
say a word of the untoward events of last evening.&nbsp; If my 
memory serves me the disasters which overtook the Majority of 
this honourable body always befell when it was the 
Minority&rsquo;s deal.&nbsp; It is my solemn conviction, Mr. 
Chairman, and to its affirmation I pledge my life, my fortune, 
and my sacred honour, that that wicked and unscrupulous Minority 
redistricted the cards!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Sportsman and the Squirrel</h2>
<p>A Sportsman who had wounded a Squirrel, which was making 
desperate efforts to drag itself away, ran after it with a stick,
exclaiming:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor thing!&nbsp; I will put it out of its 
misery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment the Squirrels stopped from exhaustion, and 
looking up at its enemy, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t venture to doubt the sincerity of your 
compassion, though it comes rather late, but you seem to lack the
faculty of observation.&nbsp; Do you not perceive by my actions 
that the dearest wish of my heart is to continue in my 
misery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this exposure of his hypocrisy, the Sportsman was so 
overcome with shame and remorse that he would not strike the 
Squirrel, but pointing it out to his dog, walked thoughtfully 
away.</p>
<h2>The Fogy and the Sheik</h2>
<p>A Fogy who lived in a cave near a great caravan route returned
to his home one day and saw, near by, a great concourse of men 
and animals, and in their midst a tower, at the foot of which 
something with wheels smoked and panted like an exhausted 
horse.&nbsp; He sought the Sheik of the Outfit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sin art thou committing now, O son of a Christian 
dog?&rdquo; said the Fogy, with a truly Oriental politeness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boring for water, you black-and-tan galoot!&rdquo; 
replied the Sheik of the Outfit, with that ready repartee which 
distinguishes the Unbeliever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knowest thou not, thou whelp of darkness and father of 
disordered livers,&rdquo; cried the Fogy, &ldquo;that water will 
cause grass to spring up here, and trees, and possibly even 
flowers?&nbsp; Knowest thou not, that thou art, in truth, 
producing an oasis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you know,&rdquo; said the Sheik of the 
Outfit, &ldquo;that caravans will then stop here for rest and 
refreshments, giving you a chance to steal the camels, the 
horses, and the goods?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May the wild hog defile my grave, but thou speakest 
wisdom!&rdquo; the Fogy replied, with the dignity of his race, 
extending his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sheik.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They shook.</p>
<h2>At Heaven&rsquo;s Gate</h2>
<p>Having arisen from the tomb, a Woman presented herself at the 
gate of Heaven, and knocked with a trembling hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Saint Peter, rising and approaching 
the wicket, &ldquo;whence do you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From San Francisco,&rdquo; replied the Woman, with 
embarrassment, as great beads of perspiration spangled her 
spiritual brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, my good girl,&rdquo; the Saint said, 
compassionately.&nbsp; &ldquo;Eternity is a long time; you can 
live that down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that, if you please, is not all.&rdquo;&nbsp; The 
Woman was growing more and more confused.&nbsp; &ldquo;I poisoned
my husband.&nbsp; I chopped up my babies.&nbsp; 
I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the Saint, with sudden austerity, 
&ldquo;your confession suggests a very grave possibility.&nbsp; 
Were you a member of the Women&rsquo;s Press 
Association?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady drew herself up and replied with warmth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gates of pearl and jasper swung back upon their golden 
hinges, making the most ravishing music, and the Saint, stepping 
aside, bowed low, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enter, then, into thine eternal rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Woman hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poisoning&mdash;the 
chopping&mdash;the&mdash;the&mdash;&rdquo; she stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of no consequence, I assure you.&nbsp; We are not going
to be hard on a lady who did not belong to the Women&rsquo;s 
Press Association.&nbsp; Take a harp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I applied for membership&mdash;I was 
blackballed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take two harps.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Catted Anarchist</h2>
<p>An Anarchist Orator who had been struck in the face with a 
Dead Cat by some Respector of Law to him unknown, had the Dead 
Cat arrested and taken before a Magistrate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you appeal to the law?&rdquo; said the 
Magistrate&mdash;&ldquo;You who go in for the abolition of 
law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; replied the Anarchist, who was not without
a certain hardness of head, &ldquo;that is none of your business;
I am not bound to be consistent.&nbsp; You sit here to do justice
between me and this Dead Cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the Magistrate, putting on the 
black cap and a solemn look; &ldquo;as the accused makes no 
defence, and is undoubtedly guilty, I sentence her to be eaten by
the public executioner; and as that position happens to be 
vacant, I appoint you to it, without bonds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the most delighted spectators at the execution was the 
anonymous Respector of Law who had flung the condemned.</p>
<h2>The Honourable Member</h2>
<p>A Member of a Legislature, who had pledged himself to his 
Constituents not to steal, brought home at the end of the session
a large part of the dome of the Capitol.&nbsp; Thereupon the 
Constituents held an indignation meeting and passed a resolution 
of tar and feathers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are most unjust,&rdquo; said the Member of the 
Legislature.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is true I promised you I would not 
steal; but had I ever promised you that I would not 
lie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Constituents said he was an honourable man and elected him
to the United States Congress, unpledged and unfledged.</p>
<h2>The Expatriated Boss</h2>
<p>A Boss who had gone to Canada was taunted by a Citizen of 
Montreal with having fled to avoid prosecution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do me a grave injustice,&rdquo; said the Boss, 
parting with a pair of tears.&nbsp; &ldquo;I came to Canada 
solely because of its political attractions; its Government is 
the most corrupt in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray forgive me,&rdquo; said the Citizen of 
Montreal.</p>
<p>They fell upon each other&rsquo;s neck, and at the conclusion 
of that touching rite the Boss had two watches.</p>
<h2>An Inadequate Fee</h2>
<p>An Ox, unable to extricate himself from the mire into which he
sank, was advised to make use of a Political Pull.&nbsp; When the
Political Pull had arrived, the Ox said: &ldquo;My good friend, 
please make fast to me, and let nature take her 
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Political Pull made fast to the Ox&rsquo;s head and 
nature took her course.&nbsp; The Ox was drawn, first, from the 
mire, and, next, from his skin.&nbsp; Then the Political Pull 
looked back upon the good fat carcase of beef that he was 
dragging to his lair and said, with a discontented spirit:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is hardly my customary fee; I&rsquo;ll take home 
this first instalment, then return and bring an action for 
salvage against the skin.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Judge and the Plaintiff</h2>
<p>A Man of Experience in Business was awaiting the judgment of 
the Court in an action for damages which he had brought against a
railway company.&nbsp; The door opened and the Judge of the Court
entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am going to decide your 
case to-day.&nbsp; If I should decide in your favour, I wonder 
how you would express your satisfaction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the Man of Experience in Business, 
&ldquo;I should risk your anger by offering you one half the sum 
awarded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I say I was going to decide that case?&rdquo; said 
the Judge, abruptly, as if awakening from a dream.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Dear me, how absent-minded I am.&nbsp; I mean I have 
already decided it, and judgment has been entered for the full 
amount that you sued for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I say I would give you one half?&rdquo; said the 
Man of Experience in Business, coldly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear me, how 
near I came to being a rascal.&nbsp; I mean, that I am greatly 
obliged to you.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Return of the Representative</h2>
<p>Hearing that the Legislature had adjourned, the people of an 
Assembly District held a mass-meeting to devise a suitable 
punishment for their representative.&nbsp; By one speaker it was 
proposed that he be disembowelled, by another that he be made to 
run the gauntlet.&nbsp; Some favoured hanging, some thought that 
it would do him good to appear in a suit of tar and 
feathers.&nbsp; An old man, famous for his wisdom and his habit 
of drooling on his shirt-front, suggested that they first catch 
their hare.&nbsp; So the Chairman appointed a committee to watch 
for the victim at midnight, and take him as he should attempt to 
sneak into town across-lots from the tamarack swamp.&nbsp; At 
this point in the proceedings they were interrupted by the sound 
of a brass band.&nbsp; Their dishonoured representative was 
driving up from the railway station in a coach-and-four, with 
music and a banner.&nbsp; A few moments later he entered the 
hall, went upon the platform, and said it was the proudest moment
of his life. (Cheers.)</p>
<h2>A Statesman</h2>
<p>A Statesman who attended a meeting of a Chamber of Commerce 
rose to speak, but was objected to on the ground that he had 
nothing to do with commerce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; said an Aged Member, rising, 
&ldquo;I conceive that the objection is not well taken; the 
gentleman&rsquo;s connection with commerce is close and 
intimate.&nbsp; He is a Commodity.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Two Dogs</h2>
<p>The Dog, as created, had a rigid tail, but after some 
centuries of a cheerless existence, unappreciated by Man, who 
made him work for his living, he implored the Creator to endow 
him with a wag.&nbsp; This being done he was able to dissemble 
his resentment with a sign of affection, and the earth was his 
and the fulness thereof.&nbsp; Observing this, the Politician (an
animal created later) petitioned that a wag might be given him 
too.&nbsp; As he was incaudate it was conferred upon his chin, 
which he now wags with great profit and gratification except when
he is at his meals.</p>
<h2>Three Recruits</h2>
<p>A Farmer, an Artisan, and a Labourer went to the King of their
country and complained that they were compelled to support a 
large standing army of mere consumers, who did nothing for their 
keep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;my 
subjects&rsquo; wishes are the highest law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he disbanded his army and the consumers became producers 
also.&nbsp; The sale of their products so brought down prices 
that farming was ruined, and their skilled and unskilled labour 
drove the artisans and labourers into the almshouses and 
highways.&nbsp; In a few years the national distress was so great
that the Farmer, the Artisan, and the Labourer petitioned the 
King to reorganize the standing army.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said the King; &ldquo;you wish to support 
those idle consumers again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, your Majesty,&rdquo; they replied&mdash;&ldquo;we 
wish to enlist.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Mirror</h2>
<p>A Silken-Eared Spaniel, who traced his descent from King 
Charles the Second of England, chanced to look into a mirror 
which was leaning against the wainscoting of a room on the ground
floor of his mistress&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; Seeing his reflection,
he supposed it to be another dog, outside, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can chew up any such milksoppy pup as that, and I 
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he ran out-of-doors and around to the side of the house 
where he fancied the enemy was.&nbsp; It so happened that at that
moment a Bulldog sat there sunning his teeth.&nbsp; The Spaniel 
stopped short in dire consternation, and, after regarding the 
Bulldog a moment from a safe distance, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether you cultivate the arts of 
peace or your flag is flung to the battle and the breeze and your
voice is for war.&nbsp; If you are a civilian, the windows of 
this house flatter you worse than a newspaper, but if 
you&rsquo;re a soldier, they do you a grave injustice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This speech being unintelligible to the Bulldog he only 
civilly smiled, which so terrified the Spaniel that he dropped 
dead in his tracks.</p>
<h2>Saint and Sinner</h2>
<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said a distinguished officer of the 
Salvation Army, to a Most Wicked Sinner, &ldquo;I was once a 
drunkard, a thief, an assassin.&nbsp; The Divine Grace has made 
me what I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Most Wicked Sinner looked at him from head to foot.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Henceforth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the Divine Grace, I 
fancy, will let well enough alone.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>An Antidote</h2>
<p>A Young Ostrich came to its Mother, groaning with pain and 
with its wings tightly crossed upon its stomach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you been eating?&rdquo; the Mother asked, 
with solicitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but a keg of Nails,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed the Mother; &ldquo;a whole keg 
of Nails, at your age!&nbsp; Why, you will kill yourself that 
way.&nbsp; Go quickly, my child, and swallow a 
claw-hammer.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>A Weary Echo</h2>
<p>A Convention of female writers, which for two days had been 
stuffing Woman&rsquo;s couch with goose-quills and hailing the 
down of a new era, adjourned with unabated enthusiasm, shouting, 
&ldquo;Place aux dames!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Echo wearily replied, 
&ldquo;Oh, damn.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Ingenious Blackmailer</h2>
<p>An Inventor went to a King and was granted an audience, when 
the following conversation ensued:</p>
<p><i>Inventor</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;May it please your Majesty, I 
have invented a rifle that discharges lightning.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>King</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Ah, you wish to sell me the 
secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Inventor</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Yes; it will enable your army to
overrun any nation that is accessible.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>King</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;In order to get any good of my 
outlay for your invention, I must make a war, and do so as soon 
as I can arm my troops&mdash;before your secret is discovered by 
foreign nations.&nbsp; How much do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Inventor</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;One million dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>King</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;And how much will it cost to make 
the change of arms?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Inventor</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Fifty millions.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>King</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;And the war will 
Cost&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Inventor</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;But consider the glory and the 
spoils!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>King</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Exactly.&nbsp; But if I am not 
seeking these advantages?&nbsp; What if I decline to 
purchase?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Inventor</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;There is no economy in 
that.&nbsp; Though a patriot, I am poor; if my own country will 
not patronise me, I must seek a market elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>King</i> (to Prime Minister).&mdash;&ldquo;Take this 
blackmailer and cut off his head.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>A Talisman</h2>
<p>Having been summoned to serve as a juror, a Prominent Citizen 
sent a physician&rsquo;s certificate stating that he was 
afflicted with softening of the brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gentleman is excused,&rdquo; said the Judge, 
handing back the certificate to the person who had brought it, 
&ldquo;he has a brain.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Ancient Order</h2>
<p>Hardly had that ancient order, the Sultans of Exceeding 
Splendour, been completely founded by the Grand Flashing 
Inaccessible, when a question arose as to what should be the 
title of address among the members.&nbsp; Some wanted it to be 
simply &ldquo;my Lord,&rdquo; others held out for &ldquo;your 
Dukeness,&rdquo; and still others preferred &ldquo;my Sovereign 
Liege.&rdquo;&nbsp; Finally the gorgeous jewel of the order, 
gleaming upon the breast of every member, suggested &ldquo;your 
Badgesty,&rdquo; which was adopted, and the order became 
popularly known as the Kings of Catarrh.</p>
<h2>A Fatal Disorder</h2>
<p>A Dying Man who had been shot was requested by officers of the
law to make a statement, and be quick about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were assaulted without provocation, of 
course,&rdquo; said the District Attorney, preparing to set down 
the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the Dying Man, &ldquo;I was the 
aggressor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I understand,&rdquo; said the District Attorney; 
&ldquo;you committed the aggression&mdash;you were compelled to, 
as it were.&nbsp; You did it in self-defence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he would have hurt me if I had let 
him alone,&rdquo; said the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, I fancy he was
a man of peace, and would not have hurt a fly.&nbsp; I brought 
such a pressure to bear on him that he naturally had to 
yield&mdash;he couldn&rsquo;t hold out.&nbsp; If he had refused 
to shoot me I don&rsquo;t see how I could decently have continued
his acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed the District Attorney, 
throwing down his note-book and pencil; &ldquo;this is all quite 
irregular.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t make use of such an ante-mortem 
statement as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never before knew a man to tell the truth,&rdquo; 
said the Chief of Police, &ldquo;when dying of 
violence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Violence nothing!&rdquo; the Police Surgeon said, 
pulling out and inspecting the man&rsquo;s tongue&mdash;&ldquo;it
is the truth that is killing him.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Massacre</h2>
<p>Some Holy Missionaries in China having been deprived of life 
by the Bigoted Heathens, the Christian Press made a note of it, 
and was greatly pained to point out the contrast between the 
Bigoted Heathens and the law-abiding countrymen of the Holy 
Missionaries who had wickedly been sent to eternal bliss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented a Miserable Sinner, as he finished
reading the articles, &ldquo;the Heathens of Ying Shing are 
deceitful above all things and desperately wicked.&nbsp; By the 
way,&rdquo; he added, turning over the paper to read the 
entertaining and instructive Fables, &ldquo;I know the Heathenese
lingo.&nbsp; Ying Shing means Rock Creek; it is in the Province 
of Wyo Ming.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>A Ship and a Man</h2>
<p>Seeing a ship sailing by upon the sea of politics, an 
Ambitious Person started in hot pursuit along the strand; but the
people&rsquo;s eyes being fixed upon the Presidency no one 
observed the pursuer.&nbsp; This greatly annoyed him, and 
recollecting that he was not aquatic, he stopped and shouted 
across the waves&rsquo; tumultous roar:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take my name off the passenger list.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back to him over the waters, hollow and heartless, like 
laughter in a tomb, rang the voice of the Skipper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;T ain&rsquo;t on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And there, in the focus of a million pairs of convergent eyes,
the Ambitious Person sat him down between the sun and moon and 
murmured sadly to his own soul:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marooned, by thunder!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Congress and the People</h2>
<p>Successive Congresses having greatly impoverished the People, 
they were discouraged and wept copiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you weep?&rdquo; inquired an Angel who had 
perched upon a fence near by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have taken all we have,&rdquo; replied the 
People&mdash;&ldquo;excepting,&rdquo; they added, noting the 
suggestive visitant&mdash;&ldquo;excepting our hope in 
heaven.&nbsp; Thank God, they cannot deprive us of 
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at last came the Congress of 1889.</p>
<h2>The Justice and His Accuser</h2>
<p>An eminent Justice of the Supreme Court of Patagascar was 
accused of having obtained his appointment by fraud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wander,&rdquo; he said to the Accuser; &ldquo;it is
of little importance how I obtained my power; it is only 
important how I have used it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I confess,&rdquo; said the Accuser, &ldquo;that in 
comparison with the rascally way in which you have conducted 
yourself on the Bench, the rascally way in which you got there 
does seem rather a trifle.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Highwayman and the Traveller</h2>
<p>A Highwayman confronted a Traveller, and covering him with a 
firearm, shouted: &ldquo;Your money or your life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good friend,&rdquo; said the Traveller, 
&ldquo;according to the terms of your demand my money will save 
my life, my life my money; you imply you will take one or the 
other, but not both.&nbsp; If that is what you mean, please be 
good enough to take my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not what I mean,&rdquo; said the Highwayman; 
&ldquo;you cannot save your money by giving up your 
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then take it, anyhow,&rdquo; the Traveller said.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;If it will not save my money, it is good for 
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Highwayman was so pleased with the Traveller&rsquo;s 
philosophy and wit that he took him into partnership, and this 
splendid combination of talent started a newspaper.</p>
<h2>The Policeman and the Citizen</h2>
<p>A Policeman, finding a man that had fallen in a fit, said, 
&ldquo;This man is drunk,&rdquo; and began beating him on the 
head with his club.&nbsp; A passing Citizen said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you murder a man that is already 
harmless?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Policeman left the man in a fit and attacked the
Citizen, who, after receiving several severe contusions, ran 
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; said the Policeman, &ldquo;why did I not 
attack the sober one before exhausting myself upon the 
other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thenceforward he pursued that plan, and by zeal and diligence 
rose to be Chief, and sobriety is unknown in the region subject 
to his sway.</p>
<h2>The Writer and the Tramps</h2>
<p>An Ambitious Writer, distinguished for the condition of his 
linen, was travelling the high road to fame, when he met a 
Tramp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with your shirt?&rdquo; inquired the
Tramp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It bears the marks of that superb unconcern which is 
the characteristic of genius,&rdquo; replied the Ambitious 
Writer, contemptuously passing him by.</p>
<p>Resting by the wayside a little later, the Tramp carved upon 
the smooth bark of a birch-tree the words, &ldquo;John Gump, 
Champion Genius.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Two Politicians</h2>
<p>Two Politicians were exchanging ideas regarding the rewards 
for public service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reward which I most desire,&rdquo; said the First 
Politician, &ldquo;is the gratitude of my 
fellow-citizens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be very gratifying, no doubt,&rdquo; said 
the Second Politician, &ldquo;but, alas! in order to obtain it 
one has to retire from politics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant they gazed upon each other with inexpressible 
tenderness; then the First Politician murmured, 
&ldquo;God&rsquo;s will be done!&nbsp; Since we cannot hope for 
reward, let us be content with what we have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And lifting their right hands from the public treasury they 
swore to be content.</p>
<h2>The Fugitive Office</h2>
<p>A Traveller arriving at the capitol of the nation saw a vast 
plain outside the wall, filled with struggling and shouting 
men.&nbsp; While he looked upon the alarming spectacle an Office 
broke away from the Throng and took shelter in a tomb close to 
where he stood, the crowd being too intent upon hammering one 
another to observe that the cause of their contention had 
departed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor bruised and bleeding creature,&rdquo; said the 
compassionate Traveller, &ldquo;what misfortune caused you to be 
so far away from the source of power?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &lsquo;sought the man,&rsquo;&rdquo; said the 
Office.</p>
<h2>The Tyrant Frog</h2>
<p>A Snake swallowing a frog head-first was approached by a 
Naturalist with a stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my deliverer,&rdquo; said the Snake as well as he 
could, &ldquo;you have arrived just in time; this reptile, you 
see, is pitching into me without provocation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied the Naturalist, &ldquo;I need a 
snakeskin for my collection, but if you had not explained I 
should not have interrupted you, for I thought you were at 
dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Eligible Son-in-Law</h2>
<p>A Truly Pious Person who conducted a savings bank and lent 
money to his sisters and his cousins and his aunts of both sexes,
was approached by a Tatterdemalion, who applied for a loan of one
hundred thousand dollars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What security have you to offer?&rdquo; asked the Truly
Pious Person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best in the world,&rdquo; the applicant replied, 
confidentially; &ldquo;I am about to become your 
son-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would indeed be gilt-edged,&rdquo; said the 
banker, gravely; &ldquo;but what claim have you to the hand of my
daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One that cannot be lightly denied,&rdquo; said the 
Tatterdemalion.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am about to become worth one 
hundred thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unable to detect a weak point in this scheme of mutual 
advantage, the financier gave the promoter in disguise an order 
for the money, and wrote a note to his wife directing her to 
count out the girl.</p>
<h2>The Statesman and the Horse</h2>
<p>A Statesman who had saved his country was returning from 
Washington on foot, when he met a Race Horse going at full speed,
and stopped it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn about and travel the other way,&rdquo; said the 
Statesman, &ldquo;and I will keep you company as far as my 
home.&nbsp; The advantages of travelling together are 
obvious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot do that,&rdquo; said the Race Horse; &ldquo;I 
am following my master to Washington.&nbsp; I did not go fast 
enough to suit him, and he has gone on ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is your master?&rdquo; inquired the Statesman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the Statesman who saved his country,&rdquo; 
answered the Race Horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There appears to be some mistake,&rdquo; the other 
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why did he wish to travel so fast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So as to be there in time to get the country that he 
saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he got it,&rdquo; said the other, and limped 
along, sighing.</p>
<h2>An &AElig;rophobe</h2>
<p>A Celebrated Divine having affirmed the fallibility of the 
Bible, was asked why, then, he preached the religion founded upon
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is fallible,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;there is 
the greater reason that I explain it, lest it mislead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then am I to infer,&rdquo; said his Questioner, 
&ldquo;that <i>you</i> are not fallible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are to infer that I am not 
pneumophagous.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Thrift of Strength</h2>
<p>A Weak Man going down-hill met a Strong Man going up, and 
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take this direction because it requires less 
exertion, not from choice.&nbsp; I pray you, sir, assist me to 
regain the summit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gladly,&rdquo; said the Strong Man, his face 
illuminated with the glory of his thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have 
always considered my strength a sacred gift in trust for my 
fellow-men.&nbsp; I will take you along with me.&nbsp; Just get 
behind me and push.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Good Government</h2>
<p>&ldquo;What a happy land you are!&rdquo; said a Republican 
Form of Government to a Sovereign State.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be good 
enough to lie still while I walk upon you, singing the praises of
universal suffrage and descanting upon the blessings of civil and
religious liberty.&nbsp; In the meantime you can relieve your 
feelings by cursing the one-man power and the effete monarchies 
of Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My public servants have been fools and rogues from the 
date of your accession to power,&rdquo; replied the State; 
&ldquo;my legislative bodies, both State and municipal, are bands
of thieves; my taxes are insupportable; my courts are corrupt; my
cities are a disgrace to civilisation; my corporations have their
hands at the throats of every private interest&mdash;all my 
affairs are in disorder and criminal confusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all very true,&rdquo; said the Republican Form 
of Government, putting on its hobnail shoes; &ldquo;but consider 
how I thrill you every Fourth of July.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Life Saver</h2>
<p>An Ancient Maiden, standing on the edge of a wharf near a 
Modern Swain, was overheard rehearsing the words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noble preserver!&nbsp; The life that you have saved is 
yours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having repeated them several times with various intonations, 
she sprang into the water, where she was suffered to drown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a noble preserver,&rdquo; said the Modern Swain, 
thoughtfully moving away; &ldquo;the life that I have saved is 
indeed mine.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Man and the Bird</h2>
<p>A Man with a Shotgun said to a Bird:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all nonsense, you know, about shooting being a 
cruel sport.&nbsp; I put my skill against your cunning-that is 
all there is of it.&nbsp; It is a fair game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the Bird, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t 
wish to play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; inquired the Man with a Shotgun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The game,&rdquo; the Bird replied, &ldquo;is fair as 
you say; the chances are about even; but consider the 
stake.&nbsp; I am in it for you, but what is there in it for 
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not being prepared with an answer to the question, the Man 
with a Shotgun sagaciously removed the propounder.</p>
<h2>From the Minutes</h2>
<p>An Orator afflicted with atrophy of the organ of common-sense 
rose in his place in the halls of legislation and pointed with 
pride to his Unblotted Escutcheon.&nbsp; Seeing what it supposed 
to be the finger of scorn pointed at it, the Unblotted Escutcheon
turned black with rage.&nbsp; Seeing the Unblotted Escutcheon 
turning black with what he supposed to be the record of his own 
misdeeds showing through the whitewash, the Orator fell dead of 
mortification.&nbsp; Seeing the Orator fall dead of what they 
supposed to be atrophy of the organ of common-sense, his 
colleagues resolved that whenever they should adjourn because 
they were tired, it should be out of respect to the memory of him
who had so frequently made them so.</p>
<h2>Three of a Kind</h2>
<p>A Lawyer in whom an instinct of justice had survived the wreck
of his ignorance of law was retained for the defence of a burglar
whom the police had taken after a desperate struggle with someone
not in custody.&nbsp; In consultation with his client the Lawyer 
asked, &ldquo;Have you accomplices?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the Burglar.&nbsp; &ldquo;I 
have two, but neither has been taken.&nbsp; I hired one to defend
me against capture, you to defend me against 
conviction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This answer deeply impressed the Lawyer, and having 
ascertained that the Burglar had accumulated no money in his 
profession he threw up the case.</p>
<h2>The Fabulist and the Animals</h2>
<p>A Wise and illustrious Writer of Fables was visiting a 
travelling menagerie with a view to collecting literary 
materials.&nbsp; As he was passing near the Elephant, that animal
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How sad that so justly famous a satirist should mar his
work by ridicule of people with long noses&mdash;who are the salt
of the earth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Kangaroo said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do so enjoy that great man&rsquo;s censure of the 
ridiculous&mdash;particularly his attacks on the 
Proboscid&aelig;; but, alas! he has no reverence for the 
Marsupials, and laughs at our way of carrying our young in a 
pouch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Camel said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he would only respect the sacred Hump, he would be 
faultless.&nbsp; As it is, I cannot permit his fables to be read 
in the presence of my family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ostrich, seeing his approach, thrust her head in the 
straw, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I do not conceal myself, he may be reminded to write
something disagreeable about my lack of a crest or my appetite 
for scrap-iron; and although he is inexpressibly brilliant when 
he devotes himself to censure of folly and greed, his dulness is 
matchless when he transcends the limits of legitimate 
comment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said the Buzzard to his mate, &ldquo;is 
the distinguished author of that glorious fable, &lsquo;The 
Ostrich and the Keg of Raw Nails.&rsquo;&nbsp; I regret to add, 
that he wrote, also, &lsquo;The Buzzard&rsquo;s Feast,&rsquo; in 
which a carrion diet is contumeliously disparaged.&nbsp; A 
carrion diet is the foundation of sound health.&nbsp; If nothing 
else but corpses were eaten, death would be unknown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing an attendant approaching, the wise and illustrious 
Writer of Fables passed out of the tent and mingled with the 
crowd.&nbsp; It was afterward discovered that he had crept in 
under the canvas without paying.</p>
<h2>A Revivalist Revived</h2>
<p>A Revivalist who had fallen dead in the pulpit from too 
violent religious exercise was astonished to wake up in 
Hades.&nbsp; He promptly sent for the Adversary of Souls and 
demanded his freedom, explaining that he was entirely orthodox, 
and had always led a pious and holy life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all very true,&rdquo; said the Adversary, 
&ldquo;but you taught by example that a verb should not agree 
with its subject in person and number, whereas the Good Book says
that contention is worse than a dinner of herbs.&nbsp; You also 
tried to release the objective case from its thraldom to the 
preposition, and it is written that servants should obey their 
masters.&nbsp; You stay right here.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Debaters</h2>
<p>A Hurled-Back Allegation, which, after a brief rest, had again
started forth upon its mission of mischief, met an Ink-stand in 
mid-air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did the Honourable Member whom you represent know 
that I was coming again?&rdquo; inquired the Hurled-back 
Allegation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not,&rdquo; the Inkstand replied; &ldquo;he 
isn&rsquo;t at all forehanded at repartee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then, do you come, things being even when he had 
hurled me back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wanted to be a little ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Two of the Pious</h2>
<p>A Christian and a Heathen in His Blindness were disputing, 
when the Christian, with that charming consideration which serves
to distinguish the truly pious from the wolves that perish, 
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could have my way, I&rsquo;d blow up all your gods
with dynamite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I could have mine,&rdquo; retorted the Heathen 
in His Blindness, bitterly malevolent but oleaginuously suave, 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d fan all yours out of the universe.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Desperate Object</h2>
<p>A Dishonest Gain was driving in its luxurious carriage through
its private park, when it saw something which frantically and 
repeatedly ran against a stone wall, endeavouring to butt out its
brains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold!&nbsp; Hold! thou desperate Object,&rdquo; cried 
the Dishonest Gain; &ldquo;these beautiful private grounds are no
place for such work as thine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the Object, pausing; &ldquo;I have 
other and better grounds for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then thou art a happy man,&rdquo; said the Dishonest 
Gain, &ldquo;and thy bleeding head is but mere dissembling.&nbsp;
Who art thou, great actor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am known,&rdquo; said the Object, dashing itself 
again at the wall, &ldquo;as the Consciousness of Duty Well 
Performed.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Appropriate Memorial</h2>
<p>A High Public Functionary having died, the citizens of his 
town held a meeting to consider how to honour his memory, and an 
Other High Public Functionary rose and addressed the meeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman and Gintlemen,&rdquo; said the Other, 
&ldquo;it sames to me, and I&lsquo;m hopin&rsquo; yez wull 
approve the suggistion, that an appropriet way to honour the 
mimory of the decaised would be to erect an emolument sootably 
inscribed wid his vartues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soul of the great man looked down from Heaven and 
wept.</p>
<h2>A Needless Labour</h2>
<p>After waiting many a weary day to revenge himself upon a Lion 
for some unconsidered manifestation of contempt, a Skunk finally 
saw him coming, and posting himself in the path ahead uttered the
inaudible discord of his race.&nbsp; Observing that the Lion gave
no attention to the matter, the Skunk, keeping carefully out of 
reach, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I beg leave to point out that I have set on foot 
an implacable odour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; the Lion replied, &ldquo;you 
have taken a needless trouble; I already knew that you were a 
Skunk.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>A Flourishing Industry</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Are the industries of this country in a flourishing 
condition?&rdquo; asked a Traveller from a Foreign Land of the 
first man he met in America.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; said the Man.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have more
orders than I can fill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your business?&rdquo; the Traveller from a 
Foreign Land inquired.</p>
<p>The Man replied, &ldquo;I make boxing-gloves for the tongues 
of pugilists.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Self-Made Monkey</h2>
<p>A Man of humble birth and no breading, who held a high 
political office, was passing through a forest, when he met a 
Monkey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take it you are one of my constituents,&rdquo; the 
Man said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the Monkey; &ldquo;but I will 
support you if you can urge a valid claim to my 
approval.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a self-made man,&rdquo; said the other, 
proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is nothing,&rdquo; the Monkey said.&nbsp; And 
going to a bigger pine, he rose by his own unaided exertions to 
the top branch, where he sat, all bedaubed with the pitch which 
that vegetable exudes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he added, 
&ldquo;I am a self-made Monkey.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Patriot and the Banker</h2>
<p>A Patriot who had taken office poor and retired rich was 
introduced at a bank where he desired to open an account.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; said the Honest Banker; &ldquo;we
shall be glad to do business with you; but first you must make 
yourself an honest man by restoring what you stole from the 
Government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; cried the Patriot; &ldquo;if I do 
that, I shall have nothing to deposit with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that,&rdquo; the Honest Banker 
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are not the whole American 
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I understand,&rdquo; said the Patriot, 
musing.&nbsp; &ldquo;At what sum do you estimate this 
bank&rsquo;s proportion of the country&rsquo;s loss by 
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a dollar,&rdquo; answered the Honest Banker.</p>
<p>And with a proud consciousness of serving his country wisely 
and well he charged that sum to the account.</p>
<h2>The Mourning Brothers</h2>
<p>Observing that he was about to die, an Old Man called his two 
Sons to his bedside and expounded the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My children,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you have not shown 
me many marks of respect during my life, but you will attest your
sorrow for my death.&nbsp; To him who the longer wears a weed 
upon his hat in memory of me shall go my entire fortune.&nbsp; I 
have made a will to that effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So when the Old Man was dead each of the youths put a weed 
upon his hat and wore it until he was himself old, when, seeing 
that neither would give in, they agreed that the younger should 
leave off his weeds and the elder give him half of the 
estate.&nbsp; But when the elder applied for the property he 
found that there had been an Executor!</p>
<p>Thus were hypocrisy and obstinacy fitly punished.</p>
<h2>The Disinterested Arbiter</h2>
<p>Two Dogs who had been fighting for a bone, without advantage 
to either, referred their dispute to a Sheep.&nbsp; The Sheep 
patiently heard their statements, then flung the bone into a 
pond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you do that?&rdquo; said the Dogs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied the Sheep, &ldquo;I am a 
vegetarian.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The Thief and the Honest Man</h2>
<p>A Thief who had brought a suit against his accomplices to 
recover his share of the plunder taken from an Honest Man, 
demanded the Honest Man&rsquo;s attendance at the trial to 
testify to his loss.&nbsp; But the Honest Man explained that as 
he was merely the agent of a company of other honest men it was 
none of his affair; and when the officers came to serve him with 
a subpoena he hid himself behind his back and wiled away the 
dragging hours of retirement and inaction by picking his own 
pockets.</p>
<h2>The Dutiful Son</h2>
<p>A Millionaire who had gone to an almshouse to visit his father
met a Neighbour there, who was greatly surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said the Neighbour, &ldquo;you do 
sometimes visit your father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If our situations were reversed,&rdquo; said the 
Millionaire, &ldquo;I am sure he would visit me.&nbsp; The old 
man has always been rather proud of me.&nbsp; Besides,&rdquo; he 
added, softly, &ldquo;I had to have his signature; I am insuring 
his life.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>AESOPUS EMENDATUS</h2>
<h3>The Cat and the Youth</h3>
<p>A Cat fell in love with a handsome Young Man, and entreated 
Venus to change her into a woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think,&rdquo; said Venus, &ldquo;you might 
make so trifling a change without bothering me.&nbsp; However, be
a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterward, wishing to see if the change were complete, Venus 
caused a mouse to approach, whereupon the woman shrieked and made
such a show of herself that the Young Man would not marry 
her.</p>
<h3>The Farmer and His Sons</h3>
<p>A Farmer being about to die, and knowing that during his 
illness his Sons had permitted the vineyard to become overgrown 
with weeds while they improved the shining hour by gambling with 
the doctor, said to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boys, there is a great treasure buried in the 
vineyard.&nbsp; You dig in the ground until you find 
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Sons dug up all the weeds, and all the vines too, and 
even neglected to bury the old man.</p>
<h3>Jupiter and the Baby Show</h3>
<p>Jupiter held a baby show, open to all animals, and a Monkey 
entered her hideous cub for a prize, but Jupiter only laughed at 
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all very well,&rdquo; said the Monkey, &ldquo;to 
laugh at my offspring, but you go into any gallery of antique 
sculpture and look at the statues and busts of the fellows that 
you begot yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Sh! don&rsquo;t expose me,&rdquo; said Jupiter, 
and awarded her the first prize.</p>
<h3>The Man and the Dog</h3>
<p>A Man who had been bitten by a Dog was told that the wound 
would heal if he would dip a piece of bread in the blood and give
it to the Dog.&nbsp; He did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Dog; &ldquo;if I were to accept 
that, it might be thought that in biting you I was actuated by 
improper motives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And by what motives were you actuated?&rdquo; asked the
Man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I desired,&rdquo; replied the Dog, &ldquo;merely to 
harmonise myself with the Divine Scheme of Things.&nbsp; 
I&lsquo;m a child of Nature.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Cat and the Birds</h3>
<p>Hearing that the Birds in an aviary were ill, a Cat went to 
them and said that he was a physician, and would cure them if 
they would let him in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what school of medicine do you belong?&rdquo; asked 
the Birds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a Miaulopathist,&rdquo; said the Cat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever practise Gohomoeopathy?&rdquo; the Birds 
inquired, winking faintly.</p>
<p>The Cat took the hint and his leave.</p>
<h3>Mercury and the Woodchopper</h3>
<p>A Woodchopper, who had dropped his axe into a deep pool, 
besought Mercury to recover it for him.&nbsp; That thoughtless 
deity immediately plunged into the pool, which became so 
salivated that the trees about its margin all came loose and 
dropped out.</p>
<h3>The Fox and the Grapes</h3>
<p>A Fox, seeing some sour grapes hanging within an inch of his 
nose, and being unwilling to admit that there was anything he 
would not eat, solemnly declared that they were out of his 
reach.</p>
<h3>The Penitent Thief</h3>
<p>A Boy who had been taught by his Mother to steal grew to be a 
man and was a professional public official.&nbsp; One day he was 
taken in the act and condemned to die.&nbsp; While going to the 
place of execution he passed his Mother and said to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold your work!&nbsp; If you had not taught me to 
steal, I should not have come to this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said the Mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;And who, 
pray, taught you to be detected?&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Archer and the Eagle</h3>
<p>An Eagle mortally wounded by an Archer was greatly comforted 
to observe that the arrow was feathered with one of his own 
quills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have felt bad, indeed,&rdquo; he said, 
&ldquo;to think that any other eagle had a hand in 
this.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Truth and the Traveller</h3>
<p>A Man travelling in a desert met a Woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo; asked the Man, &ldquo;and why dost
thou dwell in this dreadful place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name,&rdquo; replied the Woman, &ldquo;is Truth; and
I live in the desert in order to be near my worshippers when they
are driven from among their fellows.&nbsp; They all come, sooner 
or later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Man, looking about, &ldquo;the 
country doesn&rsquo;t seem to be very thickly settled 
here.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Wolf and the Lamb</h3>
<p>A Lamb, pursued by a Wolf, fled into the temple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The priest will catch you and sacrifice you,&rdquo; 
said the Wolf, &ldquo;if you remain there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just as well to be sacrificed by the priest as to
be eaten by you,&rdquo; said the Lamb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said the Wolf, &ldquo;it pains me to 
see you considering so great a question from a purely selfish 
point of view.&nbsp; It is not just as well for me.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Lion and the Boar</h3>
<p>A Lion and a Boar, who were fighting for water at a pool, saw 
some vultures hovering significantly above them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let
us make up our quarrel,&rdquo; said the Boar, &ldquo;or these 
fellows will get one of us, sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should not so much mind that,&rdquo; replied the 
Lion, &ldquo;if they would get the right one.&nbsp; However, I am
willing to stop fighting, and then perhaps I can grab a 
vulture.&nbsp; I like chicken better than pork, 
anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Grasshopper and the Ant</h3>
<p>One day in winter a hungry Grasshopper applied to an Ant for 
some of the food which they had stored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the Ant, &ldquo;did you not store up 
some food for yourself, instead of singing all the 
time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I did,&rdquo; said the Grasshopper; &ldquo;so I did;
but you fellows broke in and carried it all away.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Fisher and the Fished</h3>
<p>A Fisherman who had caught a very small Fish was putting it in
his basket when it said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pray you put me back into the stream, for I can be of
no use to you; the gods do not eat fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am no god,&rdquo; said the Fisherman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the Fish, &ldquo;but as soon as 
Jupiter has heard of your exploit, he will elevate you to the 
deitage.&nbsp; You are the only man that ever caught a small 
fish.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Farmer and the Fox</h3>
<p>A Farmer who had a deadly and implacable hatred against a 
certain Fox, caught him and tied some tow to his tail; then 
carrying him to the centre of his own grain-field, set the tow on
fire and let the animal go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the Farmer, seeing the result; 
&ldquo;if that grain had not been heavily insured, I might have 
had to dissemble my hatred of the Fox.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Dame Fortune and the Traveller</h3>
<p>A Weary Traveller who had lain down and fallen asleep on the 
brink of a deep well was discovered by Dame Fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this fool,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;should have an 
uneasy dream and roll into the well men would say that I did 
it.&nbsp; It is painful to me to be unjustly accused, and I shall
see that I am not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying she rolled the man into the well.</p>
<h3>The Victor and the Victim</h3>
<p>Two Game Cocks, having fought a battle, the defeated one 
skulked away and hid, but the victor mounted a wall and crowed 
lustily.&nbsp; This attracted the attention of a hawk, who 
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold! how pride goeth before a fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he swooped down upon the boasting bird and was about to 
destroy him, when the vanquished Cock came out of his 
hiding-place, and between the two the Hawk was calamitously 
defeated.</p>
<h3>The Wolf and the Shepherds</h3>
<p>A Wolf passing a Shepherd&rsquo;s hut looked in and saw the 
shepherds dining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said one of them, ironically, 
&ldquo;and partake of your favourite dish, a haunch of 
mutton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the Wolf, moving away, 
&ldquo;but you must excuse me; I have just had a saddle of 
shepherd.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Goose and the Swan</h3>
<p>A Certain rich man reared a Goose and a Swan, the one for his 
table, the other because she was reputed a good singer.&nbsp; One
night when the Cook went to kill the Goose he got hold of the 
Swan instead.&nbsp; Thereupon the Swan, to induce him to spare 
her life, began to sing; but she saved him nothing but the 
trouble of killing her, for she died of the song.</p>
<h3>The Lion, the Cock, and the Ass</h3>
<p>A Lion was about to attack a braying Ass, when a Cock near by 
crowed shrilly, and the Lion ran away.&nbsp; &ldquo;What 
frightened him?&rdquo; the Ass asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lions have a superstitious terror of my voice,&rdquo; 
answered the Cock, proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, well,&rdquo; said the Ass, shaking his 
head; &ldquo;I should think that any animal that is afraid of 
your voice and doesn&rsquo;t mind mine must have an uncommon kind
of ear.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Snake and the Swallow</h3>
<p>A Swallow who had built her nest in a court of justice reared 
a fine family of young birds.&nbsp; One day a Snake came out of a
chink in the wall and was about to eat them.&nbsp; The Just Judge
at once issued an injunction, and making an order for their 
removal to his own house, ate them himself.</p>
<h3>The Wolves and the Dogs</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Why should there be strife between us?&rdquo; said the 
Wolves to the Sheep.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is all owing to those 
quarrelsome dogs.&nbsp; Dismiss them, and we shall have 
peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to think,&rdquo; replied the Sheep, 
&ldquo;that it is an easy thing to dismiss dogs.&nbsp; Have you 
always found it so?&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Hen and the Vipers</h3>
<p>A Hen who had patiently hatched out a brood of vipers, was 
accosted by a Swallow, who said: &ldquo;What a fool you are to 
give life to creatures who will reward you by destroying 
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a little bit on the destroy myself,&rdquo; said 
the Hen, tranquilly swallowing one of the little reptiles; 
&ldquo;and it is not an act of folly to provide oneself with the 
delicacies of the season.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>A Seasonable Joke</h3>
<p>A Spendthrift, seeing a single swallow, pawned his cloak, 
thinking that Summer was at hand.&nbsp; It was.</p>
<h3>The Lion and the Thorn</h3>
<p>A Lion roaming through the forest, got a thorn in his foot, 
and, meeting a Shepherd, asked him to remove it.&nbsp; The 
Shepherd did so, and the Lion, having just surfeited himself on 
another shepherd, went away without harming him.&nbsp; Some time 
afterward the Shepherd was condemned on a false accusation to be 
cast to the lions in the amphitheatre.&nbsp; When they were about
to devour him, one of them said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the man who removed the thorn from my 
foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing this, the others honourably abstained, and the 
claimant ate the Shepherd all himself.</p>
<h3>The Fawn and the Buck</h3>
<p>A Fawn said to its father: &ldquo;You are larger, stronger, 
and more active than a dog, and you have sharp horns.&nbsp; Why 
do you run away when you hear one barking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, my child,&rdquo; replied the Buck, &ldquo;my 
temper is so uncertain that if I permit one of those noisy 
creatures to come into my presence I am likely to forget myself 
and do him an injury.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Kite, the Pigeons, and the Hawk</h3>
<p>Some Pigeons exposed to the attacks of a Kite asked a Hawk to 
defend them.&nbsp; He consented, and being admitted into the cote
waited for the Kite, whom he fell upon and devoured.&nbsp; When 
he was so surfeited that he could scarcely move, the grateful 
Pigeons scratched out his eyes.</p>
<h3>The Wolf and the Babe</h3>
<p>A Famishing Wolf, passing the door of a cottage in the forest,
heard a Mother say to her babe:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, or I will throw you out of the window, and 
the wolves will get you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he waited all day below the window, growing more hungry all
the time.&nbsp; But at night the Old Man, having returned from 
the village club, threw out both Mother and Child.</p>
<h3>The Wolf and the Ostrich</h3>
<p>A Wolf, who in devouring a man had choked himself with a bunch
of keys, asked an ostrich to put her head down his throat and 
pull them out, which she did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said the Wolf, &ldquo;you expect 
payment for that service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A kind act,&rdquo; replied the Ostrich, &ldquo;is its 
own reward; I have eaten the keys.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Herdsman and the Lion</h3>
<p>A Herdsman who had lost a bullock entreated the gods to bring 
him the thief, and vowed he would sacrifice a goat to them.&nbsp;
Just then a Lion, his jaws dripping with bullock&rsquo;s blood, 
approached the Herdsman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you, good deities,&rdquo; said the Herdsman, 
continuing his prayer, &ldquo;for showing me the thief.&nbsp; And
now if you will take him away, I will stand another 
goat.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Man and the Viper</h3>
<p>A Man finding a frozen Viper put it into his bosom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The coldness of the human heart,&rdquo; he said, with a
grin, &ldquo;will keep the creature in his present condition 
until I can reach home and revive him on the coals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the pleasures of hope so fired his heart that the Viper 
thawed, and sliding to the ground thanked the Man civilly for his
hospitality and glided away.</p>
<h3>The Man and the Eagle</h3>
<p>An Eagle was once captured by a Man, who clipped his wings and
put him in the poultry yard, along with the chickens.&nbsp; The 
Eagle was much depressed in spirits by the change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should you not rather rejoice?&rdquo; said the 
Man.&nbsp; &ldquo;You were only an ordinary fellow as an eagle; 
but as an old rooster you are a fowl of incomparable 
distinction.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The War-horse and the Miller</h3>
<p>Having heard that the State was about to be invaded by a 
hostile army, a War-horse belonging to a Colonel of the Militia 
offered his services to a passing Miller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the patriotic Miller, &ldquo;I will 
employ no one who deserts his position in the hour of 
danger.&nbsp; It is sweet to die for one&rsquo;s 
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in the sentiment sounded familiar, and, looking at 
the Miller more closely the War-horse recognised his master in 
disguise.</p>
<h3>The Dog and the Reflection</h3>
<p>A Dog passing over a stream on a plank saw his reflection in 
the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ugly brute!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;how dare you 
look at me in that insolent way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a grab in the water, and, getting hold of what he 
supposed was the other dog&rsquo;s lip, lifted out a fine piece 
of meat which a butcher&rsquo;s boy had dropped into the 
stream.</p>
<h3>The Man and the Fish-horn</h3>
<p>A Truthful Man, finding a musical instrument in the road, 
asked the name of it, and was told that it was a fish-horn.&nbsp;
The next time he went fishing he set his nets and blew the 
fish-horn all day to charm the fish into them; but at nightfall 
there were not only no fish in his nets, but none along that part
of the coast.&nbsp; Meeting a friend while on his way home he was
asked what luck he had had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Truthful Man, &ldquo;the weather 
is not right for fishing, but it&lsquo;s a red-letter day for 
music.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Hare and the Tortoise</h3>
<p>A Hare having ridiculed the slow movements of a Tortoise, was 
challenged by the latter to run a race, a Fox to go to the goal 
and be the judge.&nbsp; They got off well together, the hare at 
the top of her speed, the Tortoise, who had no other intention 
than making his antagonist exert herself, going very 
leisurely.&nbsp; After sauntering along for some time he 
discovered the Hare by the wayside, apparently asleep, and seeing
a chance to win pushed on as fast as he could, arriving at the 
goal hours afterward, suffering from extreme fatigue and claiming
the victory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; said the Fox; &ldquo;the Hare was here 
long ago, and went back to cheer you on your way.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Hercules and the Carter</h3>
<p>A Carter was driving a waggon loaded with a merchant&rsquo;s 
goods, when the wheels stuck in a rut.&nbsp; Thereupon he began 
to pray to Hercules, without other exertion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indolent fellow!&rdquo; said Hercules; &ldquo;you ask 
me to help you, but will not help yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Carter helped himself to so many of the most valuable 
goods that the horses easily ran away with the remainder.</p>
<h3>The Lion and the Bull</h3>
<p>A Lion wishing to lure a Bull to a place where it would be 
safe to attack him, said: &ldquo;My friend, I have killed a fine 
sheep; will you come with me and partake of the 
mutton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; said the Bull, &ldquo;as soon as 
you have refreshed yourself a little for the journey.&nbsp; Pray 
have some grass.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Man and his Goose</h3>
<p>&ldquo;See these valuable golden eggs,&rdquo; said a Man that 
owned a Goose.&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely a Goose which can lay such 
eggs as those must have a gold mine inside her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he killed the Goose and cut her open, but found that she 
was just like any other goose.&nbsp; Moreover, on examining the 
eggs that she had laid he found they were just like any other 
eggs.</p>
<h3>The Wolf and the Feeding Goat</h3>
<p>A Wolf saw a Goat feeding at the summit of a rock, where he 
could not get at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you stay up there in that sterile place and go 
hungry?&rdquo; said the Wolf.&nbsp; &ldquo;Down here where I am 
the broken-bottle vine cometh up as a flower, the celluloid 
collar blossoms as the rose, and the tin-can tree brings forth 
after its kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true, no doubt,&rdquo; said the Goat, 
&ldquo;but how about the circus-poster crop?&nbsp; I hear that it
failed this year down there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Wolf, perceiving that he was being chaffed, went away and 
resumed his duties at the doors of the poor.</p>
<h3>Jupiter and the Birds</h3>
<p>Jupiter commanded all the birds to appear before him, so that 
he might choose the most beautiful to be their king.&nbsp; The 
ugly jackdaw, collecting all the fine feathers which had fallen 
from the other birds, attached them to his own body and appeared 
at the examination, looking very gay.&nbsp; The other birds, 
recognising their own borrowed plumage, indignantly protested, 
and began to strip him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; said Jupiter; &ldquo;this self-made bird 
has more sense than any of you.&nbsp; He is your king.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Lion and the Mouse</h3>
<p>A Lion who had caught a Mouse was about to kill him, when the 
Mouse said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will spare my life, I will do as much for you 
some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lion, good-naturedly let him go.&nbsp; It happened shortly
afterwards that the Lion was caught by some hunters and bound 
with cords.&nbsp; The Mouse, passing that way, and seeing that 
his benefactor was helpless, gnawed off his tail.</p>
<h3>The Old Man and His Sons</h3>
<p>An Old Man, afflicted with a family of contentious Sons, 
brought in a bundle of sticks and asked the young men to break 
it.&nbsp; After repeated efforts they confessed that it could not
be done.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; said the Old Man, &ldquo;the
advantage of unity; as long as these sticks are in alliance they 
are invincible, but observe how feeble they are 
individually.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pulling a single stick from the bundle, he broke it easily 
upon the head of the eldest Son, and this he repeated until all 
had been served.</p>
<h3>The Crab and His Son</h3>
<p>A Logical Crab said to his Son, &ldquo;Why do you not walk 
straight forward?&nbsp; Your sidelong gait is singularly 
ungraceful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you walk straight forward 
yourself,&rdquo; said the Son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Erring youth,&rdquo; replied the Logical Crab, 
&ldquo;you are introducing new and irrelevant matter.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The North Wind and the Sun</h3>
<p>The Sun and the North Wind disputed which was the more 
powerful, and agreed that he should be declared victor who could 
the sooner strip a traveller of his clothes.&nbsp; So they waited
until a traveller came by.&nbsp; But the traveller had been 
indiscreet enough to stay over night at a summer hotel, and had 
no clothes.</p>
<h3>The Mountain and the Mouse</h3>
<p>A Mountain was in labour, and the people of seven cities had 
assembled to watch its movements and hear its groans.&nbsp; While
they waited in breathless expectancy out came a Mouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a baby!&rdquo; they cried in derision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may be a baby,&rdquo; said the Mouse, gravely, as he 
passed outward through the forest of shins, &ldquo;but I know 
tolerably well how to diagnose a volcano.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Bellamy and the Members</h3>
<p>The Members of a body of Socialists rose in insurrection 
against their Bellamy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;should we be all the time
tucking you out with food when you do nothing to tuck us 
out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, resolving to take no further action, they went away, and 
looking backward had the satisfaction to see the Bellamy 
compelled to sell his own book.</p>
<h2>OLD SAWS WITH NEW TEETH<br />
CERTAIN ANCIENT FABLES APPLIED TO<br />
THE LIFE OF OUR TIMES</h2>
<h3>The Wolf and the Crane</h3>
<p>A Rich Man wanted to tell a certain lie, but the lie was of 
such monstrous size that it stuck in his throat; so he employed 
an Editor to write it out and publish it in his paper as an 
editorial.&nbsp; But when the Editor presented his bill, the Rich
Man said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be content&mdash;is it nothing that I refrained from 
advising you about investments?&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Lion and the Mouse</h3>
<p>A Judge was awakened by the noise of a lawyer prosecuting a 
Thief.&nbsp; Rising in wrath he was about to sentence the Thief 
to life imprisonment when the latter said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg that you will set me free, and I will some day 
requite your kindness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pleased and flattered to be bribed, although by nothing but an
empty promise, the Judge let him go.&nbsp; Soon afterward he 
found that it was more than an empty promise, for, having become 
a Thief, he was himself set free by the other, who had become a 
Judge.</p>
<h3>The Hares and the Frogs</h3>
<p>The Members of a Legislature, being told that they were the 
meanest thieves in the world, resolved to commit suicide.&nbsp; 
So they bought shrouds, and laying them in a convenient place 
prepared to cut their throats.&nbsp; While they were grinding 
their razors some Tramps passing that way stole the shrouds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us live, my friends,&rdquo; said one of the 
Legislators to the others; &ldquo;the world is better than we 
thought.&nbsp; It contains meaner thieves than we.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Belly and the Members</h3>
<p>Some Workingmen employed in a shoe factory went on a strike, 
saying: &ldquo;Why should we continue to work to feed and clothe 
our employer when we have none too much to eat and wear 
ourselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Manufacturer, seeing that he could get no labour for a 
long time and finding the times pretty hard anyhow, burned down 
his shoe factory for the insurance, and when the strikers wanted 
to resume work there was no work to resume.&nbsp; So they 
boycotted a tanner.</p>
<h3>The Piping Fisherman</h3>
<p>An Editor who was always vaunting the purity, enterprise, and 
fearlessness of his paper was pained to observe that he got no 
subscribers.&nbsp; One day it occurred to him to stop saying that
his paper was pure and enterprising and fearless, and make it 
so.&nbsp; &ldquo;If these are not good qualities,&rdquo; he 
reasoned, &ldquo;it is folly to claim them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the new policy he got so many subscribers that his 
rivals endeavoured to discover the secret of his prosperity, but 
he kept it, and when he died it died with him.</p>
<h3>The Ants and the Grasshopper</h3>
<p>Some Members of a Legislature were making schedules of their 
wealth at the end of the session, when an Honest Miner came along
and asked them to divide with him.&nbsp; The members of the 
Legislature inquired:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you not acquire property of your 
own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied the Honest Miner, &ldquo;I was 
so busy digging out gold that I had no leisure to lay up 
something worth while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Members of the Legislature derided him, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you waste your time in profitless amusement, you 
cannot, of course, expect to share the rewards of 
industry.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Dog and His Reflection</h3>
<p>A State Official carrying off the Dome of the Capitol met the 
Ghost of his predecessor, who had come out of his political grave
to warn him that God saw him.&nbsp; As the place of meeting was 
lonely and the time midnight, the State Official set down the 
Dome of the Capitol, and commanded the supposed traveller to 
throw up his hands.&nbsp; The Ghost replied that he had not eaten
them, and while he was explaining the situation another State 
Official silently added the dome to his own collection.</p>
<h3>The Lion, the Bear, and the Fox</h3>
<p>Two Thieves having stolen a Piano and being unable to divide 
it fairly without a remainder went to law about it and continued 
the contest as long as either one could steal a dollar to bribe 
the judge.&nbsp; When they could give no more an Honest Man came 
along and by a single small payment obtained a judgment and took 
the Piano home, where his daughter used it to develop her biceps 
muscles, becoming a famous pugiliste.</p>
<h3>The Ass and the Lion&rsquo;s Skin</h3>
<p>A Member of the State Militia stood at a street corner, 
scowling stormily, and the people passing that way went a long 
way around him, thinking of the horrors of war.&nbsp; But 
presently, in order to terrify them still more, he strode toward 
them, when, his sword entangling his legs, he fell upon the field
of glory, and the people passed over him singing their sweetest 
songs.</p>
<h3>The Ass and the Grasshoppers</h3>
<p>A Statesman heard some Labourers singing at their work, and 
wishing to be happy too, asked them what made them so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honesty,&rdquo; replied the Labourers.</p>
<p>So the Statesman resolved that he too would be honest, and the
result was that he died of want.</p>
<h3>The Wolf and the Lion</h3>
<p>An Indian who had been driven out of a fertile valley by a 
White Settler, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that you have robbed me of my land, there is 
nothing for me to do but issue invitations to a 
war-dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t so much mind your dancing,&rdquo; said 
the White Settler, putting a fresh cartridge into his rifle, 
&ldquo;but if you attempt to make me dance you will become a good
Indian lamented by all who didn&rsquo;t know you.&nbsp; How did 
<i>you</i> get this land, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian&rsquo;s claim was compromised for a plug hat and a 
tin horn.</p>
<h3>The Hare and the Tortoise</h3>
<p>Of two Writers one was brilliant but indolent; the other 
though dull, industrious.&nbsp; They set out for the goal of fame
with equal opportunities.&nbsp; Before they died the brilliant 
one was detected in seventy languages as the author of but two or
three books of fiction and poetry, while the other was honoured 
in the Bureau of Statistics of his native land as the compiler of
sixteen volumes of tabulated information relating to the domestic
hog.</p>
<h3>The Milkmaid and Her Bucket</h3>
<p>A Senator fell to musing as follows: &ldquo;With the money 
which I shall get for my vote in favour of the bill to subsidise 
cat-ranches, I can buy a kit of burglar&rsquo;s tools and open a 
bank.&nbsp; The profit of that enterprise will enable me to 
obtain a long, low, black schooner, raise a death&rsquo;s-head 
flag and engage in commerce on the high seas.&nbsp; From my gains
in that business I can pay for the Presidency, which at $50,000 a
year will give me in four years&mdash;&rdquo; but it took him so 
long to make the calculation that the bill to subsidise 
cat-ranches passed without his vote, and he was compelled to 
return to his constituents an honest man, tormented with a clean 
conscience.</p>
<h3>King Log and King Stork</h3>
<p>The People being dissatisfied with a Democratic Legislature, 
which stole no more than they had, elected a Republican one, 
which not only stole all they had but exacted a promissory note 
for the balance due, secured by a mortgage upon their hope of 
death.</p>
<h3>The Wolf Who Would Be a Lion</h3>
<p>A Foolish Fellow who had been told that he was a great man 
believed it, and got himself appointed a Commissioner to the 
Interasylum Exposition of Preserved Idiots.&nbsp; At the first 
meeting of the Board he was mistaken for one of the exhibits, and
the janitor was ordered to remove him to his appropriate glass 
case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; he exclaimed as he was carried out, 
&ldquo;why was I not content to remain where the cut of my 
forehead is so common as to be known as the Pacific 
Slope?&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Monkey and the Nuts</h3>
<p>A Certain City desiring to purchase a site for a public 
Deformatory procured an appropriation from the Government of the 
country.&nbsp; Deeming this insufficient for purchase of the site
and payment of reasonable commissions to themselves, the men in 
charge of the matter asked for a larger sum, which was readily 
given.&nbsp; Believing that the fountain could not be dipped dry,
they applied for still more and more yet.&nbsp; Wearied at last 
by their importunities, the Government said it would be damned if
it gave anything.&nbsp; So it gave nothing and was damned all the
harder.</p>
<h3>The Boys and the Frogs</h3>
<p>Some editors of newspapers were engaged in diffusing general 
intelligence and elevating the moral sentiment of the 
public.&nbsp; They had been doing this for some time, when an 
Eminent Statesman stuck his head out of the pool of politics, 
and, speaking for the members of his profession, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friends, I beg you will desist.&nbsp; I know you 
make a great deal of money by this kind of thing, but consider 
the damage you inflict upon the business of others!&rdquo;</p>

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
